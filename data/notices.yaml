# This file is used to create temporary notices on pages on an as needed basis.
# For example when something is going to be deprecated, but has not been yet.
# To use it, add a YAML object matching the following structure:
#
# - title: "This must match the page title"
#   note: |
#     A line, or multi-line message with details.
#
#     The note can be plain text, or use Markdown.
#   type: One of NOTICE, WARNING, or DEPRECATED
#
# The 'type' field will render the div with the selfsame class applied.

- title: "Image Overview: jre"
  type: WARNING

    This image will switch from including a full complement of JDK binaries to a minimally required set in a forthcoming release. The work is being tracked in [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/chainguard-images/images/issues/297).

    If you rely on any binaries or libraries that are included in this image beyond the core JRE runtime, consider switching to the [JDK Image](/chainguard/chainguard-images/reference/jdk/overview/).

- title: "Image Overview: nginx"
  type: WARNING
  note: |
    On May 3 2023 there will be potentially breaking changes made to the Chainguard nginx image. You may
need to take action to update your application to prevent disruption. 

    Specifically, the config file is being changed to bring the default configuration closer to that of
other images. If you override the config with a custom configuration, you should not be affected.

    The changes include:

      - Moving the default port from 80 to 8080. This is required to run on Kubernetes as a non-privileged user.
      - Allowing nginx to automatically determine the number of worker processes
      - Moving the HTML directory to /usr/share/nginx/html

    You can test the new image out now by pulling the `cgr.dev/chainguard/nginx:next` image. This is a temporary variant that will be removed shortly after we make the change.
