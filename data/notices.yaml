# This file is used to create temporary notices on pages on an as needed basis.
# For example when something is going to be deprecated, but has not been yet.
# To use it, add a YAML object matching the following structure:
#
# - title: "This must match the page title"
#   note: |
#   You can use "home" to put the notice on the homepage
#     A line, or multi-line message with details.
#
#     The note can be plain text, or use Markdown.
#   type: One of NOTICE, WARNING, or DEPRECATED
#
# The 'type' field will render the div with the selfsame class applied.
# You can use the cta type for a Call to Action banner

- title: "Image Overview: jre"
  type: WARNING
  note: |
    This image will switch from including a full complement of JDK binaries to a minimally required set in a forthcoming release. The work is being tracked in [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/chainguard-images/images/issues/297).

    If you rely on any binaries or libraries that are included in this image beyond the core JRE runtime, consider switching to the [JDK Image](https://images.chainguard.dev/directory/image/jdk/overview).

# Uncomment and edit to add a call to action to the front page of Academy
