_An earlier version of this material was published in the [Fulcio chapter](https://learning.edx.org/course/course-v1:LinuxFoundationX+LFS182x+2T2022/block-v1:LinuxFoundationX+LFS182x+2T2022+type@sequential+block@2fbe6328019c4b1fbf934bd3bfb7e308/block-v1:LinuxFoundationX+LFS182x+2T2022+type@vertical+block@1f71fcbe8219471fb82e25731b18be11) of the Linux Foundation [Sigstore course](https://learning.edx.org/course/course-v1:LinuxFoundationX+LFS182x+2T2022/home)._

To inspect a certificate generated by Fulcio, we will first decode it with the `base64` command line tool, which is used for encoding and decoding binary to text. Base64 is widely used on the world wide web for binary-to-text encoding. You can check whether the tool is installed by checking whether `base64 --help` will run. If not, install Base64 with the package manager of your choice, such as apt or [Homebrew for macOS](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/base64). 

We will also use a third-party tool called `step` to inspect the decoded certificate. To install `step`, which is a tool related to public key infrastructure workflows, follow the instructions from their [official documentation](https://smallstep.com/docs/step-cli/installation).

In addition to having `base64` and `step` installed on your machine, you should also have Cosign installed, which you can achieve by following the instructions described in [How to Install Cosign](../../cosign/how-to-install-cosign).

With these prerequisites in place, you are ready to begin. 

First, we'll decode the certificate with Base64. If you don't have a certificate ready to inspect, you can generate one by following [How to Generate a Fulcio Certificate](../how-to-generate-a-fulcio-certificate).

```sh
base64 -d < fulcio.crt.base64 > fulcio.crt
```

Then, inspect the certificate using `step`’s `inspect` command.

```sh
step certificate inspect fulcio.crt
```

A sample output is below. Pay attention especially to the `x509v3 Subject Alternative Name` field, which is the e-mail associated with the party that created the signature and the issuer, which is Sigstore. The ten minute time window of validity also details the period of time for which the signature is valid.

```

We will then verify the certificate against the Fulcio certificate authority root, by using `step certificate verify` to execute the certificate path validation algorithm for x.509 certificates.

```sh
step certificate verify fulcio.crt --roots ~/.sigstore/root/targets/fulcio_intermediate_v1.crt.pem
```

The final command checks the signature in the `fulcio.sig` file, tracing the certificate up to the Fulcio root certificate.

```sh
cosign verify-blob test-file.txt --signature fulcio.sig --cert fulcio.crt.base64
```

You will receive output following this command. 

```
tlog entry verified with uuid: 727e2834d2af9389bbc49ebd798050a72698fec4fabff1433cd83071b4a6914d index: 2494952
Verified OK
```

You should receive a `Verified OK` message along with the UUID and index number of the certificate within Fulcio.
