_An earlier version of this material was published in the [Cosign chapter](https://learning.edx.org/course/course-v1:LinuxFoundationX+LFS182x+2T2022/block-v1:LinuxFoundationX+LFS182x+2T2022+type@sequential+block@204b98f35bca48c194d1868e0356bef1/block-v1:LinuxFoundationX+LFS182x+2T2022+type@vertical+block@2f0ad9cb8f124a39ab555ac8bf1a114c) of the Linux Foundation [Sigstore course](https://learning.edx.org/course/course-v1:LinuxFoundationX+LFS182x+2T2022/home)._

[Cosign](https://github.com/sigstore/cosign), developed as part of the [Sigstore project](https://www.sigstore.dev/), is a command line utility for signing, verifying, storing, and retrieving software artifacts through interface with an OCI (Open Container Initiative) registry. Cosign can be used to sign attestations, or a verifiable assertion or statement about a software artifact.

One common use case for attestations is associating a software artifact, such as an OCI container image, with a [software bill of materials (SBOM)](/open-source/sbom/what-is-an-sbom/), an inventory of the components that make up a given software artifact. Increasingly, SBOMs are considered an essential component in maintaining a secure software supply chain.

Including an SBOM with software you ship can help others trust the provenance and contents of the software. Including your SBOM as an attestation verifies that the SBOM was generated by the same trusted organization that created the software artifact, and that neither the artifact nor its associated metadata and documents have been tampered with.

In the following, we'll generate an SBOM and associate it with a specific OCI container using an attestation generated by Cosign.

## Creating a Demonstration Image

Since we'll be attaching an SBOM to a container image, we'll first need to create an example image. We'll base this image on Chainguard's [`wolfi-base`](https://edu.chainguard.dev/open-source/wolfi/overview), and add a single additional package, the venerable `cowsay` utility that prints a message along with some ASCII art. We then set the entrypoint so that, when the image is run, a message will be displayed.

Create a new folder for our Dockerfile build and change your working directory to that folder:

```sh
mkdir -p ~/example-image && cd ~/example-image
```

Create a new `Dockerfile` in the folder using Nano or your preferred text editor:

```sh
nano Dockerfile
```
Paste the following commands into the file:

```Dockerfile
FROM cgr.dev/chainguard/wolfi-base
RUN apk add cowsay
ENTRYPOINT ["cowsay", "-f", "tux", "I love FOSS!"]
```

Save the file and close Nano by pressing `CTRL + X`, `y`, and `ENTER` in succession.

Since we'll be pushing to a repository on your Docker Hub account, let's set a variable to your Docker Hub username that we can use in further commands.

```sh
DH_USERNAME=<your-username>
```

You can find your username on your Docker Hub account page. If you're logged in on the command line, you can also run the following command to find your username:

```sh
docker info | sed '/Username:/!d;s/.* //' 2> /dev/null
```

Finally, let's build and tag the image with:

```sh
docker build . -t $DH_USERNAME/example-image
```

You can test out the image by running it:

```sh
docker run $DH_USERNAME/example-image
```

This should display the "I love FOSS!" message along with some ASCII art.

## Generating an SBOM with Syft

[Syft](https://github.com/anchore/syft) is a tool that allows us to create SBOMs. If you don't already have Syft, use the following instructions to install this utility.

{{< details "How to Install Syft" >}}
{{< blurb/install_syft >}}
{{< /details >}}

Once you have Syft installed, you can generate an SBOM with the `syft` command, passing in the target image as an argument. For example, the following will use Syft to generate a list of packages present in the official `python` image on Docker Hub:

```sh
syft python
```

Now let's generate an SBOM for `example-image`, the image we built in the previous section. Run the following Syft command to generate an SBOM in SPDX format:

```sh
syft $DH_USERNAME/example-image:latest -o spdx-json > example-image.spdx.json
```
{{< details "What is SPDX?" >}}
{{< blurb/spdx >}}
{{< /details >}}

If you take a look at the contents of the file, you will find our installed package, `cowsay`, represented alongside the other packages already in our base image, `wolfi-base`. You can also check that `cowsay` is detected by Syft with the following:

```sh
syft --quiet $DH_USERNAME/example-image:latest | grep cowsay
```

```
cowsay                  3.04-r0       apk
```

In the next section, we'll associate this SBOM with our container image using Cosign.

## Attesting to the SBOM

Now that we have our SBOM file, let's associate it with our image using an attestation. In this attestation, the image will be our subject, and the generated SBOM will serve as our predicate (an assertion about the subject). In this case, we will be attesting that the image contains the packages listed in our SBOM file.

Before proceeding, let's push our image to Docker Hub, since the following commands will refer to the image on the OCI repository.

```sh
docker push $DH_USERNAME/example-image
```

Our `example-image` still has attestations derived from our base image, since all Chainguard Images come with SBOM and SLSA provenance attestations. Let's remove these attestations with the `cosign clean` command:

```sh
cosign clean $DH_USERNAME/example-image
```

We're now ready to add our attestation. Sigstore recommends referring to the image by digest and not by tag to avoid attesting to the wrong image, and attesting by tag will be removed in a future version of Cosign. The following command will set a variable to the digest of our newly pushed image:

```sh
DIGEST=$(docker inspect $DH_USERNAME/example-image |jq -c 'first'| jq .RepoDigests | jq -c 'first' | tr -d '"')
```

Alternatively, you can find the digest manually by visiting your repository on Docker Hub. 

We can now attest using our image as the subject and our generated SBOM as the predicate:

```sh
cosign attest --type spdxjson \
 --predicate example-image.spdx.json \
 $DIGEST
```

You will receive the following prompt:

```
Generating ephemeral keys...
Retrieving signed certificate...

	The sigstore service, hosted by sigstore a Series of LF Projects, LLC, is provided pursuant to the Hosted Project Tools Terms of Use, available at https://lfprojects.org/policies/hosted-project-tools-terms-of-use/.
	Note that if your submission includes personal data associated with this signed artifact, it will be part of an immutable record.
	This may include the email address associated with the account with which you authenticate your contractual Agreement.
	This information will be used for signing this artifact and will be stored in public transparency logs and cannot be removed later, and is subject to the Immutable Record notice at https://lfprojects.org/policies/hosted-project-tools-immutable-records/.

By typing 'y', you attest that (1) you are not submitting the personal data of any other person; and (2) you understand and agree to the statement and the Agreement terms at the URLs listed above.

```

Note the warnings â€” a record of the attestation will be recorded to an immutable log maintained by the Sigstore project. When you're ready, press `y` to agree and attest.

## Retrieving the Signed SBOM

Our `example-image` in our Docker Hub repository should now bear an attached SBOM as an attestation. Let's confirm that this is the case by accessing the image's SBOM from the repository using the `cosign download attestation` command:

```sh
cosign download attestation \
 $DIGEST | \
 jq -r .payload | base64 -d \
 | jq .predicate
```

This command will download the `in-toto attestation` envelope using the `cosign download attestation` command. This envelope contains information on the attestation's subject (the image) and predicate (a statement about the subject, in this case the generated SBOM). We decode this envelope from base64, an encoding used to reduce information loss while transferring data, then extract the predicate. The result should be our SBOM in SPDX-JSON:

```json
{
  "SPDXID": "SPDXRef-DOCUMENT",
  "creationInfo": {
    "created": "2024-10-09T19:16:20Z",
    "creators": [
      "Organization: Anchore, Inc",
      "Tool: syft-1.14.0"
    ],
    "licenseListVersion": "3.25"
  },
  "dataLicense": "CC0-1.0",
  "documentNamespace": "https://anchore.com/syft/image/$DH_USERNAME/example-image-15096a2c-e277-40f6-bc6e-93c5a4aff24e",
  "files": [
    {
      "SPDXID": "SPDXRef-File-bin-busybox-b93a85ec4cd132fa",
      "checksums": [
[...]
```

If we choose, we can further parse this output so we can examine the `cowsay` package we added in our `Dockerfile`:

```sh
cosign download attestation \
 $DIGEST | \
 jq -r .payload | base64 -d |\
 jq .predicate | jq .packages | \
 jq '.[] | select(.name == "cowsay")'
```

```json
{
  "SPDXID": "SPDXRef-Package-apk-cowsay-f6f3edc220b6705a",
  "copyrightText": "NOASSERTION",
  "description": "Configurable talking cow (and a few other creatures)",
  "downloadLocation": "NONE",
  "externalRefs": [
    {
      "referenceCategory": "SECURITY",
      "referenceLocator": "cpe:2.3:a:cowsay:cowsay:3.04-r0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*",
      "referenceType": "cpe23Type"
    },
    {
      "referenceCategory": "PACKAGE-MANAGER",
      "referenceLocator": "pkg:apk/wolfi/cowsay@3.04-r0?arch=x86_64&distro=wolfi-20230201",
      "referenceType": "purl"
    }
  ],
  "filesAnalyzed": true,
  "licenseConcluded": "NOASSERTION",
  "licenseDeclared": "GPL-2.0-or-later",
  "name": "cowsay",
  "packageVerificationCode": {
    "packageVerificationCodeValue": "4f82bdba8e1217f8af0abee5cadc9c2387bf4720"
  },
  "sourceInfo": "acquired package info from APK DB: /lib/apk/db/installed",
  "supplier": "NOASSERTION",
  "versionInfo": "3.04-r0"
}
```

At this point, we've attested to the contents of our image with an SBOM and confirmed that the attestation is attached to the image in our Docker Hub repository. In the next section, we'll learn how to verify the identity of the entity issuing an attestation.

## Verifying an Attestation

Cosign can also be used to verify the identity of the person or entity issuing an attestation. The following assumes you used GitHub to authenticate when attesting in the previous step.

To verify that an attestation was issued by a specific entity, we use the `cosign verify-attestation` command, specifying the email address of the issuer:

```sh
cosign verify-attestation \
 --certificate-oidc-issuer=https://github.com/login/oauth \
 --type https://spdx.dev/Document \
 --certificate-identity=emailaddress@emailprovider.com \
 $DIGEST
```

If the identity is successfully verified, an initial message similar to the following is printed to `stderr`:

```
Verification for $DH_USERNAME/example-image@sha256:545a731e803b917daf44e292b03b427427f8090c4e6c4a704e4c18d56c38539f --
The following checks were performed on each of these signatures:
  - The cosign claims were validated
  - Existence of the claims in the transparency log was verified offline
  - The code-signing certificate was verified using trusted certificate authority certificates
Certificate subject: <you@domain.com>
Certificate issuer URL: https://github.com/login/oauth
```

The remainder of the message consists of an `in-toto attestation` envelope encoded in base64. If you wish, you can retrieve the predicate from this response:

```sh
cosign verify-attestation \
 --certificate-oidc-issuer=https://github.com/login/oauth \
 --type https://spdx.dev/Document \
 --certificate-identity=emailaddress@emailprovider.com \
 $DIGEST | \
 jq -r .payload | \
 base64 -d | jq .predicate
```

At this point, you have successfully created an image, generated an SBOM for that image, associated the SBOM with the image as an attestation, and verified the identity of the issuer of the attestation. Using this workflow, you can attest to the contents of images you create, allowing others to understand the provenance of software you ship and enabling others to verify that software artifacts and associated documents originate from you.
