This guide demonstrates how to use the [Sigstore Policy Controller](https://docs.sigstore.dev/policy-controller/overview/) to prevent running containers with extra capabilities. You will create a `ClusterImagePolicy` that uses the [CUE](https://cuelang.org/) language to examine a pod spec, and only allow admission into a cluster if the pod is running with one or many [Linux capabilities](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/security-context/#set-capabilities-for-a-container) from defined set of safe capabilities flags.

## Prerequisites

To follow along with this guide, you will need the following:

* A Kubernetes cluster with administrative access. You can set up a local cluster using [**kind**](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/#installation) or use an existing cluster.
* **kubectl** — to work with your cluster. Install `kubectl` for your operating system by following the official [Kubernetes kubectl documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/#kubectl).
* [Sigstore Policy Controller](https://docs.sigstore.dev/policy-controller/overview/) installed in your cluster. Follow our [How To Install Sigstore Policy Controller](/open-source/sigstore/policy-controller/how-to-install-policy-controller/) guide if you do not have it installed, and be sure to label any namespace that you intend to use with the `policy.sigstore.dev/include=true` label.

Once you have everything in place you can continue to the first step and confirm that the Policy Controller is working as expected.

## Step 1 - Checking the Policy Controller is Denying Admission

Before creating a `ClusterImagePolicy`, check that the Policy Controller is deployed and that your `default` namespace is labeled correctly. Run the following to check that the deployment is complete:

```bash
kubectl -n cosign-system wait --for=condition=Available deployment/policy-controller-webhook && \
kubectl -n cosign-system wait --for=condition=Available deployment/policy-controller-policy-webhook
```

When both deployments are finished, verify the `default` namespace is using the Policy Controller:

```
kubectl get ns -l policy.sigstore.dev/include=true
```

You should receive output like the following:

```
NAME      STATUS   AGE
default   Active   24s
```

Once you are sure that the Policy Controller is deployed and your `default` namespace is configured to use it, run a pod to make sure admission requests are handled and denied by default:

```bash
kubectl run --image cgr.dev/chainguard/nginx:latest nginx
```

Since there is no `ClusterImagePolicy` defined yet, the Policy Controller will deny the admission request with a message like the following:

```
Error from server (BadRequest): admission webhook "policy.sigstore.dev" denied the request: validation failed: no matching policies: spec.containers[0].image
cgr.dev/chainguard/nginx@sha256:628a01724b84d7db2dc3866f645708c25fab8cce30b98d3e5b76696291d65c4a
```

In the next step, you will define a policy that ensures pods only run with safe capabilities and apply it to your cluster.

## Step 2 — Creating a `ClusterImagePolicy`

Now that you have the Policy Controller running in your cluster, and have the `default` namespace configured to use it, you can now define a `ClusterImagePolicy` to admit images.

Open a new file with `nano` or your preferred editor:

```shell
nano /tmp/cip.yaml
```

Copy the following policy to the `/tmp/cip.yaml` file:

```
apiVersion: policy.sigstore.dev/v1beta1
kind: ClusterImagePolicy
metadata:
  name: non-default-capabilities-cue
spec:
  match:
  - version: "v1"
    resource: "pods"
  images: [glob: '**']
  authorities: [static: {action: pass}]
  mode: enforce
  policy:
    includeSpec: true
    type: "cue"
    data: |
      #Allowed: "AUDIT_WRITE" |
                "CHOWN" |
                "DAC_OVERRIDE" |
                "FOWNER" |
                "FSETID" |
                "KILL" |
                "MKNOD" |
                "NET_BIND_SERVICE" |
                "SETFCAP" |
                "SETGID" |
                "SETPCAP" |
                "SETUID" |
                "SYS_CHROOT"
      spec: {
        initContainers: [...{
          securityContext: {
            capabilities: {
              add: [...#Allowed]
            }
          }
        }]
        containers: [...{
          securityContext: {
            capabilities: {
              add: [...#Allowed]
            }
          }
        }]
        ephemeralContainers: [...{
          securityContext: {
            capabilities: {
              add: [...#Allowed]
            }
          }
        }]
      }
```

The Policy Controller will check each type of container's definition (`initContainers`, `containers`, and `ephemeralContainers`) in a pod spec for any added capabilities. The controller will only admit a pod if the added capabilities are in the `#Allowed` set.

The set of allowed capabilities is defined in this portion of the CUE policy and can be added to or changed to match your specific workload's needs:

```
#Allowed: "AUDIT_WRITE" |
                "CHOWN" |
. . .
```

Save the file and then apply the policy:

```bash
kubectl apply -f /tmp/cip.yaml
```

You will receive output showing the policy is created:

```
clusterimagepolicy.policy.sigstore.dev/non-default-capabilities-cue
```

Next you will test the policy with a failing pod spec. Once you have confirmed that the admission controller is rejecting pods running with privileges, you'll create a pod that runs without unnecessary capabilities and admit it into your cluster.

## Step 3 — Testing a `ClusterImagePolicy`

Now that you have a policy defined, you can test that it successfully rejects or accepts admission requests.

Use `nano` or your preferred editor to create a new file `/tmp/pod.yaml` and copy in the following pod spec that runs with elevated privileges:

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: yolo
spec:
  containers:
  - name: "app"
    image: docker.io/ubuntu
    securityContext:
      capabilities:
        add:
        # Violates restricted-capabilities
        - NET_ADMIN
        drop:
        - ALL
```

Apply the pod spec and check for the Policy Controller admission denied message:

```
kubectl apply -f /tmp/pod.yaml
```

```
Error from server (BadRequest): error when creating "pod.yaml": admission webhook "policy.sigstore.dev" denied the request: validation failed: failed policy: non-default-capabilities-cue: spec.containers[0].image
index.docker.io/library/ubuntu@sha256:2adf22367284330af9f832ffefb717c78239f6251d9d0f58de50b86229ed1427 failed evaluating cue policy for ClusterImagePolicy: failed to evaluate the policy with error: spec.containers.0.securityContext.capabilities.add.0: 12 errors in empty disjunction: (and 12 more errors)
```

The first line shows the error message and the failing `ClusterImagePolicy` name. The second line contains the image ID, along with the specific CUE error message showing the policy violation.

Edit the `/tmp/pod.yaml` file and remove or edit the `add` portion of the `capabilities` section. If there are no extra capabilities then the section should look like the following:

```
    capabilities:
        drop:
        - ALL
```

Save and apply the spec:

```
kubectl apply -f /tmp/pod.yaml
```

The pod will be admitted into the cluster with the following message:

```
pod/yolo created
```

Since the pod spec now ensures the container does not have and extra capabilities, or only those from the `#Allowed` set, the Policy Controller evaluates the pod spec against the CUE policy and admits the pod into the cluster.

Delete the pod once you're done experimenting with it:

```
kubectl delete pod yolo
```
