## Debug Options

To include debug-level information on apko builds, add `--debug` to your build command:

```shell
docker run --rm -v ${PWD}:/work cgr.dev/chainguard/apko build --debug \
  apko.yaml hello-minicli:test hello-minicli.tar \
  -k melange.rsa.pub
```
## Common Errors

When the apk package manager is unable to resolve your requirements to a set of installable packages, you will get an error similar to this:

{{< alert context="danger" text="Error: failed to build layer image: initializing apk: failed to fixate apk world: exit status 1" />}}


There are two main root causes for this error, which we'll explain in more detail in the upcoming section:

- apk cannot find the package in the included repositories, or
- apk cannot find the apk index for your custom-built packages.

### The requested package is not in the included repositories
Make sure you've added the relevant package repositories you need and the package name is correct.
Check the [Wolfi repository](https://github.com/wolfi-dev/os) for available packages if you are building Wolfi images,
or the [Alpine APK index](https://pkgs.alpinelinux.org/packages) if you are using Alpine as base.

If this is your case, you should find error messages similar to this when enabling debug info with the `--debug` flag:

{{< alert context="danger" text="ERROR: unable to select packages: hello-minicli (no such package)" />}}

### apko is unable to find the local packages folder
With melange-built package(s), make sure you have a volume sharing your apko / melange files with the location `/work` inside the apko container.

### The apk index is missing
If you have a functional volume sharing your packages with the apko container and you're still getting this error, make sure you built a valid apk index as described in [step 4 of the Getting Started with melange Guide](/open-source/melange/tutorials/getting-started-with-melange/#step-4--building-your-apk).

If this is your case, you should find error messages similar to this when enabling debug info with the `--debug` flag:

{{< alert context="danger" text="ERROR: Not committing changes due to missing repository tags. Use --force-broken-world to override." />}}

This is how your packages directory tree should be set up, including the `APKINDEX.tgz` file for each architecture:

```
packages
├── aarch64
│   ├── APKINDEX.tar.gz
│   └── hello-minicli-0.1.0-r0.apk
├── armv7
│   ├── APKINDEX.tar.gz
│   └── hello-minicli-0.1.0-r0.apk
├── x86
│   ├── APKINDEX.tar.gz
│   └── hello-minicli-0.1.0-r0.apk
└── x86_64
    ├── APKINDEX.tar.gz
    └── hello-minicli-0.1.0-r0.apk

4 directories, 8 files
```
