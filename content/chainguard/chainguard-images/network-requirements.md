This document provides an overview of network requirements  for using [Chainguard Images](https://www.chainguard.dev/chainguard-images?utm_source=docs). To use Chainguard Images in environments with firewalls, VPNs, and IDS/IPS systems, you will need to add some rules to allow traffic into and out of your networks.

## Chainguard Hosts

This table lists the DNS hostnames, associated ports, and protocols that will need to be allowed through firewalls and proxies to use Chainguard Images:

| Hostname |Port |Protocol | Notes |
|----------|-----|---------|-------|
| cgr.dev | 443 | HTTPS | Main image registry|
| enforce.dev | 443 | HTTPS | Registry authentication |
| packages.wolfi.dev | 443 | HTTPS | Package repository|

Note that to be able to authenticate with the `enforce.dev` domain, you will need to ensure access to and from the following CIDR ranges:

## Third-party Hosts

This table lists the third-party DNS hostnames, associated ports, and protocols that will need to be allowed through firewalls and proxies to use Chainguard Images:

|Hostname |Port |Protocol |Notes |
|---------|-----|---------|------|
| ghcr.io | 443 | HTTPS | Used for wolfi development|
| *.r2.cloudflarestorage.com | 443 | HTTPS | Blob storage for cgr.dev|
| 9236a389bd48b98df91adc1bc924620.r2.cloudflarestorage.com | 443 | HTTPS | Blob storage for cgr.dev|

Note: you can use either the single `9236a389bd48b98df91adc1bc924620.r2.cloudflarestorage.com` host or the wildcard `*.rc.cloudflarestorage.com` hostname in your firewall and proxy configurations. However, the `9236a389bd48b98df91adc1bc924620.r2.cloudflarestorage.com` hostname may change at some point in the future.

## DNS Records and TTLs

Many of the hosts listed on this page use multiple DNS A records or CNAME aliases. Additionally, many A records have a short time to live of 60 seconds, and the majority are less than an hour (3600s).

If your network filters traffic based on IP addresses, ensure that any firewalls update their rules at an appropriate interval to match the TTL for each DNS record.
