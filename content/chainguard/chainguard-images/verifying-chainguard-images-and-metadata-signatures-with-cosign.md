All Chainguard Images contain verifiable signatures and build-time SBOMs (software bills of materials), features that enable users to confirm the origin of each image built and have a detailed list of everything that is packed within.

The following commands requires [Cosign](/open-source/sigstore/cosign/how-to-install-cosign/) and [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) to be installed on your machine in order to download and verify image attestations. It will pull detailed information about all signatures found for the provided image.

## Registry and Tags for Chainguard Images

Attestations are provided per image build, so you'll need to specify the correct tag and registry when pulling attestations from an image with `cosign`.

- `cgr.dev/chainguard` - the Public Registry contains our **Developer Images**, which typically comprise the `:latest` versions of an image.
- `cgr.dev/your-registry-name` - A Private/Dedicated Registry contains our **Production Images**, which include all versioned tags of an image and special images that are not available in the public registry (including FIPS images and other custom builds).

The commands listed on this page will default to the `:latest` tag, but you can specify a different tag to fetch attestations for.

## Verifying Image Signatures

Chainguard Images are signed using Sigstore and you can check the included signatures using `cosign`. The `cosign verify` command will pull detailed information about all signatures found for the provided image.

### Public Registry

```shell
IMAGE=go
cosign verify \
  --certificate-oidc-issuer=https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com \
  --certificate-identity=https://github.com/chainguard-images/images/.github/workflows/release.yaml@refs/heads/main \
  cgr.dev/chainguard/${IMAGE} | jq
```

### Private/Dedicated Registry

```shell
PARENT=your-registry-name
IMAGE=go
cosign verify \
  --certificate-oidc-issuer=https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com \
  --certificate-identity=https://github.com/chainguard-images/images-private/.github/workflows/release.yaml@refs/heads/main \
  cgr.dev/${PARENT}/${IMAGE} | jq
```

By default, this command will fetch signatures for the `:latest` tag. You can also specify the tag you want to fetch signatures for.

## Downloading Image Attestations

Attestations are signed metadata about the artifact, which can include SBOMs, vulnerability scans, or other custom predicates.

The [attestations](https://slsa.dev/attestation-model) for an image can be obtained and verified via Cosign. These are a few of the existing types:

| Attestation Type                       | Description                                                                                                                          |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `https://slsa.dev/provenance/v1`       | The [SLSA 1.0](https://slsa.dev/spec/v1.0/provenance) provenance attestation contains information about the image build environment. |
| `https://apko.dev/image-configuration` | Contains the configuration used by that particular image build, including direct dependencies, user accounts, and entry point.       |
| `https://spdx.dev/Document`            | Contains the image SBOM in SPDX format.                                                                 |

To download an attestation, use the `cosign download attestation` command and provide both the `predicate-type` and the build `platform`.

By default, this command will fetch the SBOM assigned to the `latest` tag. You can also specify the tag you want to fetch the attestation from.

To download a different attestation, replace the `--predicate-type` parameter value with the desired attestation URL identifier.

For example, the following command will obtain the SBOM for the requested image for the `linux/amd64` platform:

### Public Registry

```shell
IMAGE=go
cosign download attestation \
  --predicate-type=https://spdx.dev/Document \
  --platform=linux/amd64 \
  cgr.dev/chainguard/${IMAGE} | jq -r .payload | base64 -d | jq .predicate
```

### Private/Dedicated Registry

```shell
PARENT=your-registry-name
IMAGE=go
cosign download attestation \
  --predicate-type=https://spdx.dev/Document \
  --platform=linux/amd64 \
  cgr.dev/${PARENT}/${IMAGE} | jq -r .payload | base64 -d | jq .predicate
```

## Verifying Image Attestations

You can use the `cosign verify-attestation` command to check the signatures of the desired image [attestations](https://slsa.dev/attestation-model):

### Public Registry

```shell
IMAGE=go
cosign verify-attestation \
  --type https://spdx.dev/Document \
  --certificate-oidc-issuer=https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com \
  --certificate-identity=https://github.com/chainguard-images/images/.github/workflows/release.yaml@refs/heads/main \
  cgr.dev/chainguard/${IMAGE}
```

### Private/Dedicated Registry

```shell
PARENT=your-registry-name
IMAGE=go
cosign verify-attestation \
  --type https://spdx.dev/Document \
  --certificate-oidc-issuer=https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com \
  --certificate-identity=https://github.com/chainguard-images/images-private/.github/workflows/release.yaml@refs/heads/main \
  cgr.dev/${PARENT}/${IMAGE}
```

This will pull in the signature for the attestation specified by the `--type` parameter, which in this case is the SPDX attestation for SBOMs. You should get output that verifies the SBOM attestation signature in Cosign's transparency log:

```shell
Verification for cgr.dev/chainguard/go --
The following checks were performed on each of these signatures:
- The cosign claims were validated
- Existence of the claims in the transparency log was verified offline
- The code-signing certificate was verified using trusted certificate authority certificates
