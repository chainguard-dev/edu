Base image with just enough to run arbitrary glibc binaries.

This image is meant to be used as just a base image only. It does not contain any programs that can be run, other than `/sbin/ldconfig`.

You must bring your own artifacts to use this image, e.g. with a Docker multi-stage build. If you want locale support other than `C.UTF-8`, you must bring your own locale data as well. This may change in the future based on user feedback.

See also [musl-dynamic](https://github.com/chainguard-images/images/musl-dynamic) which is an equivalent image for running dynamically-linked musl binaries.

## Get It!

The image is available on `cgr.dev`:

```
docker pull cgr.dev/chainguard/glibc-dynamic:latest
```
