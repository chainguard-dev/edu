Minimal image with the k8s-sidecar app. **EXPERIMENTAL**

## Get It!

The image is available on `cgr.dev`:

```
docker pull cgr.dev/chainguard/k8s-sidecar:latest
```

## Using k8s-sidecar

The Chainguard k8s-sidecar image contains the k8s-sidecar python app.
The default entrypoint just runs the `k8s-sidecar` app without any flags.

This image is a drop-in replacement for the upstream image.
For full documentation on how to configure the app, check the [upstream documentation](https://github.com/kiwigrid/k8s-sidecar).

```shell
$ docker run cgr.dev/chainguard/k8s-sidecar
