Minimal image with kubectl binary. **EXPERIMENTAL**

## Get It!

The image is available on `cgr.dev`:

```
docker pull cgr.dev/chainguard/k3s:latest
```

This image is a drop in replacement for the upstream `rancher/k3s` image, which means it works everywhere you would expect.

The quickest way to test it is locally with `docker`:

```bash
docker run --rm -v `pwd`:/etc/rancher/k3s --privileged -p 6443:6443 cgr.dev/chainguard/k3s:latest

KUBECONFIG=k3s.yaml kubectl get po -A
```

You can also use it as a drop in replacement in `k3d`:

```bash
k3d cluster create -i cgr.dev/chainguard/k3s:latest
```
