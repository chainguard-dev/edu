All Chainguard Images contain verifiable signatures and high-quality SBOMs (software bill of materials), features that enable users to confirm the origin of each image built and have a detailed list of everything that is packed within.

## Verifying Image Signatures
The **rqlite** Chainguard Images are signed using Sigstore, and you can check the included signatures using `cosign`.

The following command requires [cosign](https://docs.sigstore.dev/cosign/overview/) and [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) to be installed on your machine. It will pull detailed information about all signatures found for the provided image.

```shell
cosign verify --certificate-oidc-issuer=https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com --certificate-identity=https://github.com/chainguard-images/images/.github/workflows/release.yaml@refs/heads/main cgr.dev/chainguard/rqlite | jq
```

By default, this command will fetch signatures for the `latest` tag. You can also specify the tag you want to fetch signatures for.

## Downloading and Verifying SBOMs

All Chainguard Images come with a high-quality Software Bill Of Materials (SBOM) generated at build-time. The SBOM can be downloaded using the cosign tool:

```shell
cosign download sbom --platform linux/amd64 cgr.dev/chainguard/rqlite | jq
```
By default, this command will fetch the SBOM assigned to the `latest` tag. You can also specify the tag you want to fetch the SBOM from.

With cosign 2.0+, you can use the `cosign verify-attestation` command to check the signature of an SBOM:

```shell
cosign verify-attestation \
  --type https://spdx.dev/Document \
  --certificate-oidc-issuer=https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com \
  --certificate-identity=https://github.com/chainguard-images/images/.github/workflows/release.yaml@refs/heads/main \
  cgr.dev/chainguard/rqlite
```

And you should get output that verifies the SBOM signature in cosign's transparency log:

```
Verification for cgr.dev/chainguard/rqlite --
The following checks were performed on each of these signatures:
- The cosign claims were validated
- Existence of the claims in the transparency log was verified offline
- The code-signing certificate was verified using trusted certificate authority certificates
