Base images with just enough files to run static binaries!

These images are meant to be used as a base image only and cannot be run directly.

There are two variants: `latest`, which contains base OS files from
[Alpine](https://www.alpinelinux.org/) and `latest-glibc` which contains base OS files from
[Wolfi](https://github.com/wolfi-dev/os). 

Both are largely equivalent and can be used to host completely static binaries, such as those
generated by gcc, rust or go with the appropriate arguments, as shown in the examples below. There is
no libc implementation in either image, despite the naming convention. 

See [musl-dynamic](https://github.com/chainguard-images/images/tree/main/images/musl-dynamic) and [glibc-dynamic](https://github.com/chainguard-images/images/tree/main/images/glibc-dynamic) for images with the C standard library included.

## Get It!

The image is available on `cgr.dev`:

```
docker pull cgr.dev/chainguard/static:latest
```

## Usage

Here's an example Dockerfile that builds a Rust static binary
and puts it into the static image:

```Dockerfile
FROM cgr.dev/chainguard/rust as build

RUN echo 'fn main() { println!("Hello"); }' > hello.rs
RUN rustc -C target-feature=+crt-static hello.rs

FROM cgr.dev/chainguard/static:latest

COPY --from=build /work/hello /hello
CMD ["/hello"]
```
To build and run it:

```bash
$ docker build -t rusty-cgr --file examples/Dockerfile.rust .
...
$ docker run rusty-cgr
Hello
```

Note the size!

```bash
$ docker images rusty-cgr
REPOSITORY   TAG       IMAGE ID       CREATED          SIZE
rusty-cgr    latest    c3793a4d4270   22 seconds ago   3.33MB
```
And a C static binary:

```Dockerfile
# syntax=docker/dockerfile:1.4
FROM cgr.dev/chainguard/gcc-glibc as build

COPY <<EOF /hello.c
#include <stdio.h>
int main() { printf("Hello!"); }
EOF
RUN cc -static /hello.c -o /hello

FROM cgr.dev/chainguard/static:latest

COPY --from=build /hello /hello
CMD ["/hello"]
```

To build and run it:

```bash
$ docker build -t c-cgr -f examples/Dockerfile.c .
...
$ docker run c-cgr
Hello!
```

It's even smaller:

```bash
$ docker images c-cgr
REPOSITORY   TAG       IMAGE ID       CREATED         SIZE
c-cgr         latest    a6671209830b   9 seconds ago   2.78MB
```

For Go programs, we recommend using [ko](https://github.com/google/ko) and setting
the `defaultBaseImage` to `cgr.dev/chainguard/static`.

## Users

The image has a single user `nonroot` with uid `65532`, belonging to gid `65532`.
