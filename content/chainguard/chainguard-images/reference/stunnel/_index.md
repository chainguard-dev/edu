<!--overview:start-->
This image contains the CLI for the [stunnel](https://www.stunnel.org/) networking tool
<!--overview:end-->

## Download this Image

The image is available on `cgr.dev`:

```
docker pull cgr.dev/chainguard/stunnel:latest
```


<!--body:start-->

This tool can be used to encrypt network connections between a client and server, without changing those programs.

`stunnel` requires a configuration file to run.
This image does not include a default configuration file.
You will need to provide your own configuration file and set it using the  at `/etc/conf/stunnel.conf` when running the container.
Note: this location can be overridden with the positional command line argument.

## Use It!

The image can be run directly and sets the `stunnel` binary as the entrypoint.

```
$ docker run cgr.dev/chainguard/stunnel:latest
