<!--overview:start-->
Contour is an ingress controller for Kubernetes that works by deploying the Envoy proxy as a reverse proxy and load balancer. Contour supports dynamic configuration updates out of the box while maintaining a lightweight profile.

## Download this Image

The image is available on `cgr.dev`:

```
docker pull cgr.dev/chainguard-private/contour:latest
```


<!--body:start-->

### Usage

To deploy Contour with our image, modify the `contour.yaml` file and apply it using kubectl:

```bash
curl -s https://projectcontour.io/quickstart/contour.yaml \
    | sed "s|ghcr.io/projectcontour/contour:.*|cgr.dev/chainguard/contour:latest|g" \
    | kubectl apply -f -
```
#### Test it out!

You should see the following:

* 2 Contour pods each with status Running and 1/1 Ready
* 1+ Envoy pod(s), each with the status Running and 2/2 Ready

Now that you have installed Contour and Envoy, letâ€™s install a web application workload and get some traffic flowing to the backend.

To install httpbin, run the following:

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://projectcontour.io/examples/httpbin.yaml
```

Verify the pods and services are running:

```bash
kubectl get po,svc,ing -l app=httpbin
```

You should see the following:

* 3 instances of pods/httpbin, each with status Running and 1/1 Ready
* 1 service/httpbin CLUSTER-IP listed on port 80
* 1 Ingress on port 80

Next, we can `kubectl port-forward` to get traffic to Envoy:

```bash
kubectl -n projectcontour port-forward service/envoy 8888:80
```

In a browser or via curl, make a request to http://local.projectcontour.io:8888

```bash
curl -s http://local.projectcontour.io:8888/
```

Congratulations, you have installed Contour, deployed a backend application, created an Ingress to route traffic to the application, and successfully accessed the app with Contour!

For further next steps, you can also continue with [official docs](https://projectcontour.io/getting-started/#next-steps) to play around
