## Get It

The image is available on `cgr.dev`:

```
docker pull cgr.dev/chainguard/flux
```

## Using `flux`

The `flux` cli contains various functionality to interact with the flux gitops toolkit components in a running cluster.

> NOTE: Many `flux` commands assume a properly connected `kubectl` context, which isn't usually the case when running through docker.

```bash
# Install the flux gitops toolkit using chainguard images
docker run cgr.dev/chainguard/flux export --registry cgr.dev/chainguard | kubectl apply -f -
```
