Minimal image with the Virus Total CLI - `vt-cli`.

## Get It!

The image is available on `cgr.dev`:

```
docker pull cgr.dev/chainguard/vt:latest
```

This image contains the `vt-cli` tool.
Note that you will need an api key for most operations.
This can be configured with `vt init`, with the `--apikey` flag, or with the `VTCLI_APIKEY` environment variable.
