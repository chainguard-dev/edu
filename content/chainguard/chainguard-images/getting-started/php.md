The PHP images maintained by Chainguard are a mix of development and production distroless images that are suitable for building and running PHP workloads.

Because PHP applications typically require the installation of third-party dependencies via Composer, using a pure distroless image for building your application would not work. In cases like this, you'll need to implement a [multi-stage Docker build](https://docs.docker.com/build/building/multi-stage/) that uses one of the `-dev` images to set up the application.

In this guide, we'll set up a distroless container image based on Wolfi as a runtime to execute a command-line PHP application.

## Step 1: Setting up a Demo Application

We'll start by creating a basic command-line PHP application to serve as a demo. This app will generate random names based on a list of nouns and adjectives. To exemplify usage with Composer, the app will have a single dependency on [minicli](https://github.com/minicli/minicli), a minimalist CLI framework for PHP.

First, create a directory for your app. In this guide we'll use `wolfi-php`:

```shell
mkdir ~/wolfi-php && cd ~/wolfi-php
```

If you have a local PHP development environment with Composer, you can run the following command to download the single dependency of this app.

```
composer require minicli/minicli
```

If you don't have a local PHP development environment, you can use the `php:latest-dev` image variant with a volume in order to install application dependencies with Composer:

```shell
docker run --rm -v ${PWD}:/work --entrypoint composer --user root \
    cgr.dev/chainguard/php:latest-dev \
    require minicli/minicli --working-dir=/work
```

If you used the Docker method, make sure permissions are set correctly on the generated files.

On Linux systems run the following:

```shell
sudo chown -R ${USER}.${USER} .
```

On macOS systems, run this:

```shell
sudo chown -R ${USER} .
```

Create a new file to serve as the application entry point. We'll call it `namegen`:

```shell
touch namegen
```

Next, open the file in your code editor of choice, for example with `nano`:

```shell
nano namegen
```

The following PHP script defines a minimalist CLI app with a single command called `get`. It returns a random name based on a list of nouns and a list of adjectives.

```php
#!/usr/bin/php
<?php

require __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';

use Minicli\App;

$app = new App();

$app->registerCommand('get', function () use ($app) {

    $animals = [ 'turtle', 'seagull', 'octopus', 'shark', 'whale', 'dolphin', 'walrus', 'penguin', 'seahorse'];
    $adjectives = [ 'ludicrous', 'mischievous', 'graceful', 'fortuitous', 'charming', 'ravishing', 'gregarious'];

    $app->getPrinter()->info($adjectives[array_rand($adjectives)] . '-' . $animals[array_rand($animals)]);
});

$app->runCommand($argv);

```

Copy this content to your `namegen` script, save and close the file. Next, make the script executable with:

```shell
chmod +x namegen
```

You can now execute the app to test it out. If you have `php` locally, run:

```shell
php namegen get
```

If you're using the Docker setup, run:

```shell
docker run --rm -v ${PWD}:/work \
    cgr.dev/chainguard/php:latest \
    /work/namegen get
```

The command should output a random name combination:

```shell
ludicrous-walrus
```

The demo application is now ready. In the next step, you'll create a Dockerfile to run your app.

## Step 2: Creating the Dockerfile

To make sure our final image is _distroless_ while still being able to install dependencies with Composer, our build will consist of **two** stages: first, we'll build the application using the `dev` image variant, a Wolfi-based image that includes Composer and other useful tools for development.
Then, we'll create a separate stage for the final image. The resulting image will be based on the distroless PHP Wolfi image, which means it doesn't come with Composer or even a shell.

Create a Dockerfile with:

```shell
touch Dockerfile
```

Then open this file in your code editor of choice, for example `nano`:

```shell
nano Dockerfile
```
The following Dockerfile will:

1. Start a new build stage based on the `php:latest-dev` image and call it `builder`;
2. Copy files from the current directory to the `/app` location in the container;
3. Enter the `/app` directory and run `composer install` to install any dependencies;
4. Start a new build stage based on the `php:latest` image;
5. Copy the application from the `builder` stage;
6. Set up the application as entry point for this image.

Copy this content to your own `Dockerfile`:

```Dockerfile
FROM cgr.dev/chainguard/php:latest-dev AS builder
USER root
COPY . /app
RUN chown -R php /app
USER php
RUN cd /app && \
    composer install --no-progress --no-dev --prefer-dist

FROM cgr.dev/chainguard/php:latest
COPY --from=builder /app /app

ENTRYPOINT [ "php", "/app/namegen" ]
```
Save the file when you're finished.

You can now build the image with:

```shell
docker build . -t php-namegen
```

Once the build is finished, run the image with:

```shell
docker run --rm php-namegen get
```

And you should get output similar to what you got before, with a random name combination.

```
fortuitous-octopus
```

If you inspect the image with a `docker image inspect php-namegen`, you'll notice that it has only **two** layers, thanks to the use of a multi-staging Docker build.

```shell
docker image inspect php-namegen
```
```shell
...
        "RootFS": {
            "Type": "layers",
            "Layers": [
                "sha256:23a50695d43b8aea7720c05bff1bdbfbcb45d0b0c7e7387f55d82110084002eb",
                "sha256:9b900cbd280a3d510588c3b14bc937718ccee43a10b8b7b1756438b030bc3e15"
            ]
        },
        "Metadata": {
            "LastTagTime": "2023-01-10T19:02:13.062958609+01:00"
        }
    }
]

```
In such cases, the last `FROM` section from the Dockerfile is the one that composes the final image. That's why in our case it only adds one layer on top of the base `php:latest` image, containing the `COPY` command we use to copy the application from the build stage to the final image.

It's worth highlighting that nothing is carried from one stage to the other unless you copy it. That facilitates creating a slim final image with only what's necessary to execute the application.
