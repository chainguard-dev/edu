The Chainguard platform supports Single sign-on (SSO) authentication for users. By default, users can log in with GitHub, GitLab and Google, but SSO support allows users to bring their own identity provider for authentication. 

This guide outlines how to create an Azure Active Directory (AD) Application and integrate it with Chainguard Enforce. After completing this guide, you'll be able to log in to Chainguard Enforce using Azure AD and will no longer be limited to the default SSO options.


## Prerequisites

To complete this guide, you will need the following.

* `chainctl` installed on your system. Follow our guide on [How To Install `chainctl`](/chainguard/chainguard-enforce/how-to-install-chainctl/) if you don't already have this installed.
* An Azure account you can use to set up an Active Directory Application. 


## Create an Azure Active Directory Application

To integrate the Azure AD identity provider with the Chainguard platform, log in to [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com) and navigate to the Azure Active Directory console in the Azure portal.

There, select the **App registrations** tab and click **New registration**.

In the **Register an application** screen, configure the application as follows.

* **Name**: Set the username to "Chainguard" (or similar) to ensure users recognize this application is for authentication to the Chainguard platform.
* **Supported account types**: Select the **Single tenant** option so that only your organization can use this application to authenticate to Chainguard.
* **Redirect URI**: Set the platform to **Web** and the redirect URI to `https://issuer.enforce.dev/oauth/callback`.

Save your configuration by clicking the **Register** button.

Next, you can optionally set additional branding for the application by selecting the **Branding and properties** tab.

There, you can set additional metadata for the application, including a Chainguard logo icon here to help your users visually identify this integration. If you'd like, you can use the icon from the [Chainguard Enforce Console](https://console.enforce.dev/logo512.png). The console homepage is [console.enforce.dev](https://console.enforce.dev), and our terms of service and private statements can be found at [chainguard.dev/terms-of-service](https://www.chainguard.dev/terms-of-service) and [chainguard.dev/privacy-notice](https://www.chainguard.dev/privacy-notice), respectively. 

![Screenshot of the Branding & properties screen with the following settings: Name is set to "Chainguard"; Logo shows the sample Inky logo uploaded; Home page URL is set to "https://console.enforce.dev"; Terms of service URL is set to "https://www.chainguard.dev/terms-of-service"; and the Privacy statement URL is set to "https://www.chainguard.dev/privacy-notice".](aad-branding.png)

Finally, navigate to the **Certificates & secrets** tab to create a client secret to authenticate the Chainguard platform to Azure Active Directory. Select **New client secret** to add a client secret. In the resulting modal window, add a description and set an expiration date.

Finally, take note of the client secret “Value” that is created. You'll need this to configure the Chainguard platform to use this Azure Active Directory application.

## Configuring Chainguard to use Azure Active Directory

To configure Chainguard, make a note of the following details from your Azure Active Directory application:

* **Application (client) Id**: This can be found on the **Overview** tab of the Chainguard AD application.
* **Client Secret**: You noted this down when you set up the  clientsecret in the previous step.
* **Directory (tenant) Id**: This can also be found on the **Overview** tab of the Chainguard AD application.

![Screenshot of the Azure AD Overview tab showing the Essentials information. THe Application (client) ID and the Directory (tenant) ID are both highlighted in red circles.](aad-8.png)

Next, log in to Chaingaurd with `chainctl`, using an OIDC provider like Google, Github, or GitLab to bootstrap your account.

```sh
chainctl auth login
```

Note that this bootstrap account can be used as a [backup account](/chainguard/chainguard-enforce/authentication/custom-idps/#backup-accounts) (that is, a backup account you can use to log in if you ever lose access to your primary account). However, if you prefer to remove this rolebinding after configuring the custom IDP, you may also do so.

Create a new identity provider using the details you noted from your Azure Active Directory application. 

```sh
export NAME=azure-ad
export CLIENT_ID=<your application/client id here>
export CLIENT_SECRET=<your client secret here>
export TENANT_ID=<your directory/tenant id here>
export ISSUER="https://login.microsoftonline.com/${TENANT_ID}/v2.0"
chainctl iam identity-provider create \
  --configuration-type=OIDC \
  --oidc-client-id=${CLIENT_ID} \
  --oidc-client-secret=${CLIENT_SECRET} \
  --oidc-issuer=${ISSUER} \
  --oidc-additional-scopes=email \
  --oidc-additional-scopes=profile \
  --name=${NAME}
```

You’ll be prompted to select a Chainguard IAM group under which to install your identity provider. Your selection won’t affect how your users authenticate but will have implications on who has permission to modify the SSO configuration.
