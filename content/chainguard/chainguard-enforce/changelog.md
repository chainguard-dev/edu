Customer facing changes: N/A

### v0.1.68
Release date: 2023-02-08
#### API Change
- Expose new customer managed identity provider API
#### Feature
- Now when chainctl refreshes auth it will default to the subject of the pre-existing token when --identity isn't passed.


### v0.1.67
Release date: 2023-02-07
#### Feature
- Filter policies and cluster records to a specific image with the `--image` flag.
- chainctl can now detect when it is running in a github actions environment when assuming an identity via chainctl auth login --identity {ID}
- add support for precreating identities that can be assumed by more than one identity.
#### Other (Cleanup or Flake)
- match upstream workload selector logic and add tests
- TrustRoot support for the definition of certificate and timestamp authorities and TUF remote references.
- Error when policies contain unknown fields
- Support to reference policies via an URL or a ConfigMap. This is especially important when the size of the policy is big.

### v0.1.66
Release date: 2023-02-06

Customer facing changes: N/A

### v0.1.65
Release date: 2023-02-06
#### Feature
- chainctl: add sigstore ca describe command
- Users can now remove rolebinding using `chainctl iam rolebinding delete`
- chainctl now supports policy versioning! Updating or editing a policy creates a new version. Interact with policy versions using `chainctl policy versions` commands `list`, `view` and `activate`.
- terraform provider now support managing Enforce Signing certificate authorities with the `chainguard_sigstore` resource
- Surface a new Identities API and chainguard_identity terraform rule.
#### Other (Cleanup or Flake)
- RoleBinding deletion is now "hard", which avoids a problem where deleted rolebindings could not be recreated.
- chainctl will no longer detect google credentials automatically unless it is in STS mode for the agent, or assuming an identity.
#### Uncategorized
- Set the User-Agent for webhooks to `Chainguard Enforce {commit}`.


### v0.1.64
Release date: 2023-01-26
#### Uncategorized

### v0.1.63

Customer facing changes: N/A

### v0.1.62
Release date: 2023-01-24

Customer facing changes: N/A

### v0.1.61
Release date: 2023-01-23
#### Feature
- Add `--headless` flag to `chainctl auth` for logins on headless instances, and to bypass cloud provider metadata endpoints.
- Add support for cluster location affinity in the terraform provider.
- New configuration values `default.group` and `default.active-within` are available for commands that offer a `--group` or `--active-within` filter flag, respectively. Explicitly provided flags override any default value. `default.identity-provider` can be used to bypass the identity provider selection screen when logging in to `chainctl`.
#### Bug or Regression
- role binding IDs will now use our standard UIDP path shape like other resources, and be rooted under the Group resource it pertains to.  We will (soon) replace all existing RoleBindings with equivalent versions that adhere to this pattern.  These should not require any user action, or have any user-facing impact other than things getting the new ID shape.


### v0.1.60

Release date: 2023-01-10
#### Feature
- We will now observe and model Tekton resources, when they are installed.
- terraform-provider now default's to the enforce.dev production environment instead of the decomissioned guak.dev environment
- non-Kubernetes GCP runtimes can now take advantage of GCP audit logs to react in near real-time to deployment events (similar to Kubernetes informers).  This needs the latest release of https://github.com/chainguard-dev/terraform-google-chainguard-account-association to be applied.

Release date: 2023-01-03
#### Feature
- Introduce a "chainctl cluster discover" command for automatically discovering (and enrolling) clusters.
- Search for packages within your clusters with `chainctl cluster search`
#### Bug or Regression
- Fix authentication for fetchConfigFile with private images (multi-arch images are still broken pending an upstream fix)
- image references should now use a consistently normalized form with a hostname and no tag.  DockerHub references will always get prefixed with index.docker.io (even if written without a host, or with docker.io), and "official" images will have the prefix: index.docker.io/library.  Tags will be stripped, even if specified alongside a digest.  For example, ubuntu:latest@sha256:deadbeef will become: index.docker.io/library/ubuntu@sha256:deadbeef

- Remove AWS and GCP account associations with `chainctl iam groups remove-aws` and `remove-gcp`, respectively.
