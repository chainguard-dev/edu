Chainguard generates and emits [CloudEvents](https://cloudevents.io/) based on actions that occur within a Chainguard account, such as creating an IAM invitation or an image being pushed to your repository.

Check out [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/chainguard-dev/enforce-events) for some sample applications that demonstrate how to use events to create Slack notifications, open GitHub issues, and mirror images.

To subscribe to Chainguard events for your account, use the `chainctl` command like this:

```
chainctl events subscriptions create –parent $YOUR_ORGANIZATION_OR_FOLDER https://<Your webhook URL>
```

Once you are subscribed to Chainguard events, you will start receiving HTTP POST requests. Each request has a common set of CloudEvent header fields, denoted by the `Ce-` prefix. The event body is encoded using JSON and will have two top-level keys, `actor` and `body`.

The `actor` field is the identity of the actor in your Chainguard account that triggered the event (e.g. the team member who pulled an image) . The `body` field contains the specific data about the event, for example the response status for an invite creation request.

## UIDP Identifiers

Each Chainguard event includes a `Ce-Subject` header that contains a UIDP (UID Path) identifier. Identifiers follow POSIX directory semantics and components are separated by `/` delimiters. A UIDP is comprised of:

* A globally unique identifier (UID), consisting of 20 bytes, that are URL safe hex encoded. For example, account identities like `0475f6baca584a8964a6bce6b74dbe78dd8805b6`.

* One, or multiple `/` separated, scoped unique identifiers (SUID). An SUID is 8 bytes that are unique within a scope (like a group), and are URL safe hex encoded. The following is an example SUID: `b74ce966caf448d1`. SUIDs are used to identify every entity in Chainguard, from groups, policies, Kubernetes cluster IDs, event subscriptions, to IAM invitations, roles and role-bindings.

Since Chainguard groups can contain child groups, events in a child group will propagate to the parent and thus the UIDP will contain multiple group SUIDs, along with the entity SUID itself. For example, assuming the following components:

* An account UID of `0475f6baca584a8964a6bce6b74dbe78dd8805b6`
* A group SUID of `b74ce966caf448d1`
* A child of group `b74ce966caf448d1` with its own SUID of `dda9aab2d2d90f9e`

The complete UIDP in the event's `Ce-Subject` header would be:

```
0475f6baca584a8964a6bce6b74dbe78dd8805b6/b74ce966caf448d1/dda9aab2d2d90f9e/1a4b29ca6df80013
```

## Authorization Header

Every Chainguard event has a JWT formatted [OIDC ID token](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-basic-1_0.html#IDToken) in its `Authorization` header. For authorization purposes, there are two important fields to validate:

1. Use the `iss` field to ensure that the issuer is Chainguard, specifically `https://issuer.enforce.dev`.
2. Use the `sub` field to check that the event matches your configured Chainguard identity. For example, assuming a UIDP ID of `0475f6baca584a8964a6bce6b74dbe78dd8805b6`, the value will resemble the following: `webhook:0475f6baca584a8964a6bce6b74dbe78dd8805b6`. If the subscription is in a sub-group, then the value will have the corresponding group SUID appended to the path.

Validating these fields before processing the JWT token using a verification library can save resources, as well as alert about suspicious traffic, or misconfigured Chainguard group settings.
