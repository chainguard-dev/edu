[Chainguard Containers](https://www.chainguard.dev/chainguard-images?utm_source=cg-academy&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=dev-enablement) are a collection of container images designed for security and minimalism. Many Chainguard Containers are [distroless](/chainguard/chainguard-images/getting-started-distroless/); they contain only an open-source application and its runtime dependencies. These container images do not even contain a shell or package manager, because fewer dependencies reduce the potential attack surface of images.

By minimizing the number of dependencies and thus reducing their potential attack surface, Chainguard Containers inherently contain few to zero CVEs. Chainguard Containers are rebuilt nightly to ensure they are completely up-to-date and contain all available security patches. With this nightly build approach, our engineering team sometimes [fixes vulnerabilities before they’re detected](https://www.chainguard.dev/unchained/how-chainguard-fixes-vulnerabilities?utm_source=cg-academy&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=dev-enablement).

The main features of Chainguard Containers include:

* Minimalist design, with no unnecessary software bloat
* Automated nightly builds to ensure Containers are completely up-to-date and contain all available security patches
* [High quality build-time SBOMs](/chainguard/chainguard-images/working-with-images/retrieve-image-sboms/) (software bill of materials) attesting the provenance of all artifacts within the Container
* [Verifiable signatures](/chainguard/chainguard-images/working-with-images/retrieve-image-sboms/) provided by [Sigstore](/open-source/sigstore/cosign/an-introduction-to-cosign/)
* Reproducible builds with Cosign and apko ([read more about reproducibility](https://www.chainguard.dev/unchained/reproducing-chainguards-reproducible-image-builds))

Because of their minimalist design, Chainguard Containers sometimes require users to adjust their image workflows. This document is intended to serve as a migration guide for customers transitioning their organizations to use Chainguard Containers. It includes general tips and strategies for migrating to Chainguard Containers as well as a curated set of migration-related resources.

## Migration Key Points

* Most Chainguard Containers have no shell or package manager by default. This is great for security, but sometimes you need these things, especially in builder images. For those cases we have development container images (also known as `-dev` images, as in `cgr.dev/chainguard/python:latest-dev`) which do include a shell and package manager.
* The development variants and `wolfi-base` / `chainguard-base` use BusyBox by default, so any `groupadd` or `useradd` commands will need to be ported to `addgroup` and `adduser`.
* The free Starter tier of Containers provides only the `:latest` and `:latest-dev` versions. Our paid Production Containers offer tags for major and minor versions.
* Chainguard Containers are [based on `glibc`](/chainguard/chainguard-images/about/images-compiled-programs/glibc-vs-musl/) and our packages cannot be mixed with Alpine packages (which are instead based on musl).
* In some cases, the entrypoint in Chainguard Containers can be different from equivalent images based on other distros, which can lead to unexpected behavior. You should always check the image's specific documentation to understand how the entrypoint works.
* When needed, Chainguard recommends using a base image like `chainguard-base` or a development variant to install an application's OS-level dependencies.

Perhaps the best place for most users to get started with migrating to Chainguard Containers is by following our guide on [How to Port a Sample Application to Chainguard Containers](/chainguard/migration/porting-apps-to-chainguard/). This guide involves updating a sample application made up of three services to use Chainguard Containers. Although the application involved is fairly simple, the concepts outlined in the guide can also be useful for migrating more complex applications.

### Development Containers

As mentioned previously, Chainguard's standard container images typically do not include a shell or package manager. This helps to minimize the size of containers and also reduces their potential attack surface, but many users find that they need images that include a shell or package manager to support their specific use case. For this reason, Chainguard offers development containers (also known as `-dev` variants, since their image tags are appended with `-dev`). These variants come with more tooling than our standard container images, including a shell and package manager. 

Although development variants are still more secure than most popular container images based on other distros, for increased security on production environments we recommend combining them with a distroless variant in a multi-stage build.

Refer to our guide on [Chainguard's Container variants](/chainguard/chainguard-images/about/differences-development-production/) for more information on development containers.

## Before Migrating

Before you begin actively migrating to Chainguard Containers, review the images that your organization has access to and determine which teams and applications will be using each image. Notify the teams involved in the migration process so they can begin preparing. For teams that are new to Chainguard Containers, we recommend taking the online self-paced course, [Linky’s Guide to Chainguard Containers](https://courses.chainguard.dev/path/linkys-guide-to-chainguard-images).

Next, determine which users and/or systems are going to need access to your Chainguard registry in order to begin preparing access. Most customers will need to copy images from their Chainguard registry into their organization's registry. An easy way to do this is by configuring the organization's registry as a pull-through mirror of the Chainguard registry. TWe have a guide on [how to configure Artifactory](/chainguard/chainguard-registry/pull-through-guides/artifactory/artifactory-images-pull-through/) for this use case.


## Recommended Rollout Approach

When the goal is to migrate multiple deployments to Chainguard Containers, a major consideration is the strategy in which these container images are rolled out and deployed throughout your environment. The recommended rollout strategy for most customers is as follows:

* Start with less complex and non-critical applications to build confidence before migrating mission-critical workloads.
* Employ a gradual approach where you choose a small subset of container images and deploy those first to a non-production environment for testing and validation, and then to a small percentage of production instances and then gradually scale up.
* Use strategies like blue-green deployments or canary releases to introduce the updated container images gradually into production.

We understand that customers may have urgent timelines and need to accelerate Chainguard Container deployment by rolling out many images to a larger percentage of production simultaneously. For customers to be successful in this accelerated approach, we recommend the following:

* Have internal Chainguard Container champions identified and ready to lead and assist cross-functionally across teams.
* Your teams participating in the Chainguard Container migration should have the following technical skillset:
    * Familiarity with tools used to build images and run containers such as Docker CLI, Dockerfiles (including multi-stage builds), and orchestration platforms (Kubernetes, ECS, etc).
    * Experience using appropriate deployment security standards (such as the [Kubernetes Pod Security Standards](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/security/pod-security-standards/)).
    * Experience debugging containers that have no shell.
* Review and understand concepts in the [Shared Responsibility Model](/chainguard/chainguard-images/about/shared-responsibility-model/).
* Your organization should already have a mature container strategy in place, including:
    * Mature and Established UAT and regression testing processes.
    * Automated CI/CD with permissions restrictions and auditing.
    * Monitoring, logging and runtime security.

Finally, as you plan for the migration to Chainguard Containers you should ensure there’s a clear rollback plan in case of unforeseen issues during migration. Keep the previous container image tagged and accessible for quick redeployment if necessary. 

### Adding certificates

A common requirement for many customers is to add a company specific certificate or other security related content. The three most common ways to accomplish this are:

1. [Incert](/chainguard/chainguard-images/features/incert-custom-certs/)
2. Dockerfile and `update-ca-certificates` utility
3. Dockerfile and java keytool

The process of adding or updating certificates, configuring APK repositories, and implementing other organization-specific customizations into an image is commonly known as creating a “Golden Image”. This approach enables these standard modifications to be applied once and then distributed across all teams, thereby reducing the risk of errors and minimizing friction during the migration process.

### Image Type Considerations

Many Chainguard customers use both application and base container images, but it often takes more time to migrate your applications to a base image in comparison to an application image due to the complexity of coordinating multiple teams, testing, and release schedules. We recommend starting with and migrating to application images first while your teams get trained and onboarded with base images.

####  Application Images

When migrating to a [Chainguard Application Container](/chainguard/chainguard-images/about/images-categories/#application-containers) you should first check the image’s overview page on the [Containers  Directory](https://images.chainguard.dev) for usage details and any compatibility notes. There may be user, permissions, or volume path differences with the Chainguard Image that you should be aware of. 

It is a best practice to use the same version of the Chainguard Application Image as what is currently running in your environment, if that version is availble from Chainguard. Post-migration you should thoroughly test and monitor your application.

#### Base Images

When migrating to a [Chainguard Base Container](/chainguard/chainguard-images/about/images-categories/#base-containers) you should first check the images’s overview page on the [Containers Directory](https://images.chainguard.dev) for usage details and any compatibility remarks. You should understand the libraries, runtime requirements, and operating system dependencies of the applications you plan to have running on the base image. 

It is a best practice to use the same versions of any languages or applications that will be running on the Chainguard Base Container as what is currently running in your environment. Do not upgrade language or application versions at the same time that you migrate. Post-migration you should test and monitor your application as outlined below in Section 6.

If you need a package to use with your Chainguard Base Container, ChainguardOS packages are available using `apk`. Ensure you only use ChainguardOS packages, as Alpine APKs are not compatible with ChainguardOS. Additionally, it is important to note that vendor provided packages need to be [glibc](/chainguard/chainguard-images/about/images-compiled-programs/glibc-vs-musl/) based and their functionality should be fully tested along with the application. 


### Extending Chainguard Containers

You can take advantage of Chainguard's [Custom Assembly](/chainguard/chainguard-images/features/ca-docs/custom-assembly/) and [Private APK Repositories](/chainguard/chainguard-images/features/private-apk-repos/) features to extend your container images

Custom Assembly allows users to create customers container images with extra packages added. This reduces their risk exposure by creating container images that are tailored to their internal organization and application requirements while still having few-to-zero CVEs.

Private APK Repositories, meanwhile, allow customers to pull secure apk packages from Chainguard. The list of packages available in an organization’s private repository is based on the apk repositories that the organization already has access to. For example, say your organization has access to the [Chainguard MySQL container image](https://images.chainguard.dev/directory/image/mysql/versions). Along with `mysql`, this image comes with other apk packages, including `bash`, `openssl`, and `pwgen`. This means that you'll have access to these apk packages through your organization's private APK repository, along with any others that appear in Chainguard container images that your organization has access to. 


## Tips for Migrating to Chainguard Containers
Although not fully comprehensive, it can be helpful to keep the following list of tips and strategies in mind when migrating to Chainguard Containers.

* Use development variants when you need a shell
* If necessary, install a different shell
* Use `apk search` to find the utilities needed by your application
* Beware of entrypoint differences between Chainguard Containers and their upstream counterparts
* Be aware that Chainguard Containers typically do not run as root by default
* If packages you need are missing, install them into a base image, preferably as part of a multi-stage build

Each of these tips and strategies are explained in greater detail in our guide on [Container Migration Tips](/chainguard/migration/migration-tips/).


## Troubleshooting

The move to a distroless workflow can be confusing for both individual developers and larger teams. We recommend taking the following steps when you encounter issues as you begin using Chainguard Containers:

* **Debugging Distroless Container Images**: Debugging distroless images can be challenging due to the absence of a shell and package manager.
    * **Temporary Rebuild with `-dev` Tag**: Temporarily rebuild your image using the development variant to get a shell and other debugging tools. This is useful for local troubleshooting or in developer clusters.
        * Remember to remove the `-dev` tag before merging. 
    * **Ephemeral Debug Containers**: In Kubernetes, use `kubectl debug` to launch an ephemeral container attached to the existing Pod for troubleshooting.
    * **Docker Debug**: While `docker debug` is available, it requires a Docker Desktop Pro license.
    * **`cdebug` and `kubectl debug`**: These tools allow you to enter a running container for debugging and can access the target container's file system.
    * **`chainctl images diff`**: This command allows you to compare two container images and identify differences between them.
* **General Troubleshooting Tips**:
    * Check the image's overview page in the [Containers Directory](https://images.chainguard.dev/) for specific usage details.
    * If you encounter issues, use a development image as a starting point.
    * Ensure you've replaced `apt install` or equivalent commands with `apk add`.
    * If elevated privileges are needed, use `USER root` before commands that require administrative access, then switch back to a non-root user before finalizing the image build.
    * Always check the image documentation for entrypoint details, as they may vary from other distributions. You can find entrypoint details in the [Specifications tab](https://images.chainguard.dev/directory/image/python/specifications) on any image's entry in the [Containers Directory](https://images.chainguard.dev/).
