The CLI tool `chainctl` helps you interact with the account model that Chainguard Enforce provides, and enables you to make queries into the state of your clusters and policies registered with the platform. The tool uses the familiar `<context> <noun> <verb>` style of CLI interactions. Below find the current reference for `chainctl`.

To install `chainctl`, follow the [installation guide](/chainguard/chainguard-enforce/how-to-install-chainctl/).
