`chainctl` (Chainguard Control) is a CLI tool that helps you control aspects of your Chainguard account and resources. You can use it to manage users, roles, images, tokens, and more. In many ways, `chainctl` parallels the abilities of the <ins>[Chainguard Console](https://console.chainguard.dev)</ins>, but with a different user interface that is both more complex and more powerful.

Like most control commands that end with `ctl`, such as `systemctl` or `loginctl`, `chainctl` uses the familiar `<context> <noun> <verb>` syntax.

This page lists a curated set of `chainctl` resources to help you get started.

To install `chainctl`, follow our <ins>[installation guide](/chainguard/administration/how-to-install-chainctl/)</ins>.

Once installed, these will help you on your path to success:
