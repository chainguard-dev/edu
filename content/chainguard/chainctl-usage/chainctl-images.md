This page presents some of the more common ways to learn about the Chainguard container images that are available to you. We use `chainctl images` commands to list available repositories and container images, examine images more closely, and compare them to one another.

For a full reference of all commands with details and switches, see [chainctl Reference](/chainguard/chainctl/).


## List Available Chainguard Container Images

When you want to know which Chainguard Containers are available to your account, use the following command:

```shell
chainctl images list
```

This will respond with a list of organizations available to your account. For most users, there will only be one entry in the list. This example shows an account with access to several organizations within the fictional MyCorp.

```shell
    Which organization would you like to list images from?                                                       
                                                                                                                        
  > [MyCorp-prod]     This group holds the production Chainguard Containers hosted under    cgr.dev/MyCorp-prod                   
    [MyCorp-starter]     This group holds the starter Chainguard Containers hosted under    cgr.dev/MyCorp-starter  
    [MyCorp-eval]     This group holds the evaluation Chainguard Containers hosted under    cgr.dev/MyCorp-eval  
```

Move the `>` up and down with the arrow keys and hit `Enter` to select the appropriate org. Then the command will return the list.

Be warned, that list may take a while to generate and is likely to scroll past quickly in your command line terminal. You may prefer to direct the output into a file.

Here's an abbreviated example of what will be returned:

```shell
...
├ [python]
│ ├ sha256:038449621d30e512645107e6b141fbfb5320d8f0caacd3d788e5a3be8da16def
│ │ ├ [3.11]
│ │ └ [3.11.12]
│ ├ sha256:07756f3cf511a6227ae70d816c57b01a6fd9e805a587db5ebb4e17a5954b38c4
│ │ └ [3.11.9]
│ ├ sha256:088b946519e5c766685e335366abe8a6160e3bd108a6525309f7186e943a4666
│ │ └ [3.11.9-dev]
│ ├ sha256:09cb17be345eac82e3fdb017590d5907c582b4bd5ac86ed5e054bae739a9babd
│ │ └ [3.13.0]
│ ├ sha256:16b52893f316d9d7074b9c24c30f82eab1e94356461439d4be1a62fe229e6933
│ │ └ [3.12.7]
│ ├ sha256:1b53a821fe44d699687d1ca2318e3f90fed4af97833ab40384ea77c746b54ed9
│ │ └ [3.10.16]
│ ├ sha256:1c3e412aff5bddf54718d1bc0b4598ea30d18005e7dbfeb7e68bdae0f874682b
│ │ ├ [3]
│ │ ├ [3.13]
│ │ ├ [3.13.3]
│ │ └ [latest]
...
```


This will continue until all images (like `python` above) are listed with all their variants (releases like `3.13.3`). Notice that the list is not necessarily in order of release.


## List Available Container Repos

For a list of image repositories available to your account, use:

```shell
chainctl images repos list
```


## Examine the History of Container Images

To examine the history of an image tag in chainctl, like when it was updated and the associated digests for each update, use `chainctl images history`. This will also return information such as how many times a variant has been built and for which platforms, along with the time and digests for each.

To examine the history without using the menu shown earlier, use the optional `--parent=$ORGANIZATION` switch to designate your org, like this:

```shell
chainctl images history $IMAGE:$TAG --parent=$ORGANIZATION
```

For example, let's find the history of one of the `python` image variants from our previous list, `3.12.7`. So we enter:

```shell
chainctl images history python:3.12.7 --parent=chainguard.edu
```


The returned list is longer than is shown here, but here's a useful excerpt:

```

The command returns a reverse-chronological history of when a specific tag was updated to point to a new manifest digest. If images are not multi-arch, only a single digest without architecture will be displayed.

When the release version tag is not provided, the command will present you with a menu that lets you select which tag you'd like to obtain the history for. For example, if you enter:


```
chainctl images history python --parent=chainguard.edu
```

This will present you with a menu like this:


```
    Which tag of python would you like to view history for?  
                                                             
  > 3

    3.10                                                     
    3.10-dev                                                 
    3.10.14                                                  
    3.10.14-dev                                              
    3.10.14-r2                                               
    3.10.14-r2-dev                                           
    3.10.14-r3                                               
    3.10.14-r3-dev                                           
    3.10.14-r4                                               
    3.10.14-r4-dev                                           
    3.10.14-r5                                               
 
```

Once you make a selection, the details will be returned for that variant.


## Compare Chainguard Container Images

When you want to compare two Chainguard images, enter:

```shell
chainctl images diff $FROM_IMAGE $TO_IMAGE
```
