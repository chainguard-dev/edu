This page presents some of the more commonly used `chainctl images` commands. For a full reference of all commands with details and switches, see [chainctl Reference](/chainguard/chainctl/).


## chainctl images list

To see which Chainguard Images are available to your account, use:

```shell

```


## chainctl images diff

This useful command enables you to compare two Chainguard images. To use it, enter:

chainctl images diff $FROM_IMAGE $TO_IMAGE
```
