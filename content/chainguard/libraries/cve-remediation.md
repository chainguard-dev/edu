CVE remediation is a feature in Chainguard Libraries that provides security
protection against critical and high CVEs, while medium or low CVEs are not
considered. Applications often rely on older versions of libraries, but upstream
maintainers may not apply and release patches for those versions. CVE
remediation addresses this gap by applying vulnerability fixes from newer
releases to older releases, particularly in cases where maintainers are no
longer able to support and provide fixes.

CVE remediation helps reduce risk for organizations that cannot always upgrade
quickly, especially when a larger upgrade to newer versions forces often disruptive
changes. CVE remediation makes multiple incremental patch versions of affected
older versions available, allowing a very minor upgrade that only
addresses the CVE, but does not introduce other changes.

CVE remediation is available for a subset of [Chainguard Libraries for
Python](/chainguard/libraries/python/overview/). If you want to request CVE
remediation for additional libraries, reach out to your account team.

## About CVE remediation

CVE remediation focuses on critical and high vulnerabilities. Chainguard
backports fixes that are already available in the new versions of the upstream
project to older versions that may no longer receive updates.

Before publishing a remediated version, Chainguard validates that the remediated
version does not introduce regressions. All upstream test suites are run before
and after applying the fix to confirm functional consistency. Chainguard also
develops additional regression tests to validate the effectiveness of the CVE
fix.

Remediated libraries are distributed through a dedicated repository. This
provides the option to make remediated versions available for your development
or opt out of using these versions completely and continue to use upstream
versions only.


## Browse libraries with CVE remediation

Remediated libraries are published in a dedicated PyPI-compatible index: `https://libraries.cgr.dev/python-remediated/` (simple index at `https://libraries.cgr.dev/python-remediated/simple/`). 

You can:
- Browse them in the Chainguard Console
- Use the public VEX feed to understand what has been remediated
- View them in a browser at the simple index URL
    - Learn more in [Python Overview > Manual access](/chainguard/libraries/python/overview/#manual-access).
- Expose them to your developers via a repo manager 
    - Learn more in the Python global configuration docs:
        - [JFrog Artifactory](/chainguard/libraries/python/global-configuration/#jfrog-artifactory)
        - [Cloudsmith](/chainguard/libraries/python/global-configuration/#cloudsmith)
        - [Sonatype Nexus](/chainguard/libraries/python/global-configuration/#sonatype-nexus-repository)


### Browse remediations in the Chainguard Console

In the Chainguard Console, navigate to the Python libraries, then click the **Remediations** tab. Click into a library to see which versions have remediated CVEs.

Learn more in [Browsing Chainguard libraries](/chainguard/libraries/browse/).

### Public VEX feed

Advisories for each CVE addressed in our remediated libraries are published via
a public VEX feed at
[https://libraries.cgr.dev/openvex/v1/all.json](https://libraries.cgr.dev/openvex/v1/all.json).
Supported scanners and your own custom tooling can use this feed to identify and
recognize remediated versions.

To view more details on the CVE and versions of a library that have been remediated, identify the library then navigate to the URL. For example: `https://libraries.cgr.dev/openvex/v1/pypi/urllib3.openvex.json`. 

## Scanning remediated libraries

Chainguard works closely with scanner partners so that remediated versions are
properly recognized in vulnerability reports. This ensures that teams can
maintain their existing scanning workflows while benefiting from patched
dependencies.

Find more general information and specifics for supported scanners in
[Vulnerability Scanners and Chainguard
Libraries](/chainguard/libraries/scanners/).
