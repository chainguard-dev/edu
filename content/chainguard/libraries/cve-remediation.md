CVE remediation is a feature in Chainguard Libraries that provides security
protection against high and critical CVEs. Applications often rely on older
versions of libraries, but upstream maintainers may not apply and release
patches for those versions. CVE remediation addresses this gap by applying
vulnerability fixes from newer releases to older releases, particularly in cases where
maintainers are no longer able to support and provide fixes.

CVE remediation helps reduce risk for organizations that cannot always upgrade
quickly, especially when a larger upgrade to newer versions forces often disruptive
changes. CVE remediation makes multiple incremental patch versions of affected
older versions available, allowing a very minor upgrade that only
addresses the CVE, but does not introduce other changes.

CVE remediation is available for a subset of [Chainguard Libraries for
Python](/chainguard/libraries/python/overview). If you want to request CVE
remediation for additional libraries, reach out to your account team.

## About CVE Remediation

CVE remediation focuses on high and critical vulnerabilities. Chainguard
backports fixes that are already available in the new versions of the upstream
project to older versions that may no longer receive updates.

Before publishing a remediated version, Chainguard validates that the remediated
version does not introduce regressions. All upstream test suites are run before
and after applying the fix to confirm functional consistency. Chainguard also
develops additional regression tests to validate the effectiveness of the CVE
fix.

Remediated libraries are distributed through a dedicated repository. This
provides the option to make remediated versions available for your development
or opt out of using these versions completely and continue to use upstream
versions only.

Advisories for each CVE addressed in our remediated libraries are published via
a public VEX feed at
[https://libraries.cgr.dev/openvex/v1/all.json](https://libraries.cgr.dev/openvex/v1/all.json).
Supported scanners and your own custom tooling can use this feed to identify and
recognize remediated versions.

## Scanning Remediated Libraries

Chainguard works closely with scanner partners so that remediated versions are
properly recognized in vulnerability reports. This ensures that teams can
maintain their existing scanning workflows while benefiting from patched
dependencies.

Grype supports Chainguard remediated libraries starting with Grype **version
0.100.0**. You can use Grype in multiple ways:

- Scan the Python virtual environment directly. If your Python application is
  not containerized, this is recommended.
- Alternatively, scan the container image for your Python application. Grype
  detects and accounts for remediated library versions inside the image.

When scanning a Python project source directory that contains a dependency file
such as `requirements.txt`, Grype reports against the declared versions rather
than the installed versions. As a result, Chainguard’s remediated Python package
versions are not recognized in this mode. To ensure accurate results, we
recommend scanning the installed environment, such as a Python virtual
environment directory, instead.

For additional guidance, see our documentation on [Using Grype to Scan Container
Images for
Vulnerabilities](/chainguard/chainguard-images/staying-secure/working-with-scanners/grype-tutorial/).
