CVE Remediation is a feature in Chainguard Libraries that provides security protection against high and critical CVEs. Applications often rely on older versions of libraries, but upstream maintainers may not apply and release patches for those versions. CVE Remediation addresses this gap by applying vulnerability fixes from upstream to older releases, particularly in cases where maintainers are no longer able to support and provide fixes. 

CVE Remediation helps reduce risk for organizations that cannot always upgrade quickly, without forcing disruptive dependency changes. This feature is included with [Chainguard Libraries for Python](/chainguard/libraries/python/overview). CVE Remediation is available for a subset of Chainguard Libraries for Python. If you want to request CVE Remediation for additional libraries, reach out to your account team.

## About CVE Remediation
CVE Remediation focuses on high and critical vulnerabilities across several Python libraries. Chainguard backports fixes that are already available in the upstream project to older versions that may no longer receive updates.

Before publishing a remediated version, Chainguard validates that the remediated version does not introduce regressions. All upstream test suites are run before and after applying the fix to confirm functional consistency. Chainguard also develops additional regression tests to validate the effectiveness of the CVE fix.

Remediated libraries are distributed through a dedicated repository, giving you the option to choose when and whether to consume remediated versions.

To provide transparency, advisories for each CVE addressed in our remediated libraries are published via a public VEX feed
at <https://libraries.cgr.dev/openvex/v1/all.json>. Supported scanners use this feed to identify and recognize remediated versions.

## Scanning Remediated Libraries

Chainguard works closely with scanner partners so that remediated versions are properly recognized in vulnerability reports. This ensures that teams can maintain their existing scanning workflows while benefiting from patched dependencies.

Currently, Grype supports Chainguard remediated libraries starting with Grype **version 0.100.0**. You can use Grype in multiple ways:
- Scan the container image for your Python application as you would normally. Grype will detect and account for remediated versions inside the image.
- Scan the Python virtual environment directly. If your Python application is not containerized, this is recommended.

For additional guidance, see our documention on [Using Grype to Scan Container Images for Vulnerabilities](/chainguard/chainguard-images/staying-secure/working-with-scanners/grype-tutorial/index).
