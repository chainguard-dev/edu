Chainguard Libraries provide enhanced security for open source dependencies in
the Java, JavaScript, and Python ecosystems, addressing critical supply chain
vulnerabilities through automated patching and continuous monitoring. Modern
applications rely heavily on libraries from public repositories like [Maven
Central](https://central.sonatype.com/), [npm Registry](https://www.npmjs.com/),
and [PyPI](https://pypi.org/), but these dependencies often contain
vulnerabilities that put applications at risk.

## Background

Open source libraries distributed through public repositories face several
security challenges: maintainers may not promptly address vulnerabilities,
binary artifacts can be compromised, and the sheer volume of transitive
dependencies makes manual security management impractical. While these
repositories enable rapid development, they also introduce supply chain risks
that traditional security approaches struggle to address.

While convenient, these services remove the direct link from your application to
the source code of a specific project, and create a potential risk for quality
issues with the artifacts, man-in-the-middle attacks, removal or override of
libraries with vulnerable or malicious versions, and other issues. The
[Supply-chain Levels for Software Artifacts (SLSA)](https://slsa.dev/)
specification describes these risks and how to protect your software against
them.

Although this is a common way of accessing open source binaries, it requires you
to put tremendous trust into the following aspects for the dozen or even
hundreds of open source libraries you typically use for each application:

* Maintainers and especially release managers of the projects
* Local workstation or CI setup used for the release build
* Release process mechanisms to create the binaries
* Transport of the binaries from the build system to the public repositories
* Management of access to the repositories
* Monitoring of repositories for attacks as well as harmful or malicious
  binaries
* Traffic to public repositories and attacks on the transport to your
  infrastructure

There are no real guarantees as to the actual provenance of the software code.
Repositories also vary greatly in quality and there is no guarantee that the
upstream source of a project is available in a repository. In addition, these
repositories also hold non-open source binaries of libraries.

All these factors create uncertainty. Using these public repositories can feel
as opaque as picking up a USB drive off of the sidewalk and plugging it into
your laptop.

## Introduction

Chainguard Libraries builds all available libraries from source code in the
Chainguard Factory and makes them available for you. The Chainguard Factory
is Chainguard's internal tooling that enables a more secure, dedicated,
private, and SLSA-certified build infrastructure for building software from
source and publishing the binaries to customers.

Chainguard Libraries and the use of the Chainguard Factory remove many software
supply chain problems for libraries:

* All binary libraries and library versions are built within the trusted
  Chainguard infrastructure directly from the source code of the official
  project.
* Binaries are handled and managed only by Chainguard and made exclusively
  available for your consumption.
* Any supply chain attacks at build and distribution are eliminated, since all
  steps from the source to your use are handled by Chainguard.
* If there is no open source code available, no binaries are made available by
  Chainguard. This eliminates any license-related risks from commercial
  libraries. The policy and process to have no binaries without source also
  removes the danger from malicious artifacts, since these artifacts do not
  provide source code in public code repositories.

Chainguard Libraries is available for the following library ecosystems:

* Java and the larger Java Virtual Machine (JVM) ecosystem with
  [Chainguard Libraries for Java](/chainguard/libraries/java/overview/)
* JavaScript and the larger ecosystem around JavaScript, TypeScript, npm, React,
  and others with 
  [Chainguard Libraries for JavaScript](/chainguard/libraries/javascript/overview/)
* Python and the larger ecosystem with
  [Chainguard Libraries for Python](/chainguard/libraries/python/overview/)
