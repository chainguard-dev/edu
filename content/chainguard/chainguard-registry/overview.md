The Chainguard Registry provides public access to all public Chainguard Images, and provides customer access for image variants through login and authentication.

While all public Chainguard Images are freely available, logging in with a Chainguard account and authenticating when pulling from the registry provides a mechanism for Chainguard to contact you if there are any current or known upcoming issues with images you are pulling.

If you would like to learn more about **Chainguard Images**, you can review our [Images documentation](/chainguard/chainguard-images/overview/), and you can request further information through our [inquiry form](https://www.chainguard.dev/contact?utm_source=docs).
