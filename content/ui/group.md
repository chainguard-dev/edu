Using `chainctl`, you can check for the ID of your group.

```sh
chainctl iam groups ls -o table
```

You'll receive output in the form of a table with information about your current groups, similar to the following.

```
                     ID                    |       NAME       | DESCRIPTION
-------------------------------------------+------------------+--------------

  b9adda06841c1d34dfa73d5902ed44b5448b7958 | enforce-demo-group |
```

> **Note**: If you don't receive output like the above at all, you can create a new group by running `chainctl iam groups create --no-parent` to create a new group. After group creation, you can run `chainctl iam groups ls -o table` again.

Next, create a variable that stores the ID in the left column for later steps in this tutorial. In the following command, replace `$GROUP_ID` with the relevant ID.

```sh
export GROUP=$GROUP_ID
```

In the UI, you can also check for groups to which you belong from the filter modal, which you can open by using the group selector on the left navigation menu.

You can check here to see the groups to which you belong and filter resources based on group ownership.
