The October 2025 Learning Lab with Manfred Moser covers Chainguard Libraries for
JavaScript and CVE remdiation with Chainguard Libraries for Python. It starts
with an overview about libraries and the JavaScript ecosystem and moves on to a
demo with npm and pnpm. In the second section Manfred explains the approach for
CVE remediation and shows an example project with remediation and scanning with
grype.

## JavaScript demo

The demonstration of Chainguard Libraries for JavaScript walks through the
[minimal example for
pnpm](/chainguard/libraries/javascript/build-configuration/#pnpm-minimal) with
direct access to the registry and with access to a local repository manager, and
shows an equivalent project with npm as well.

## CVE remediation demo

The example project to showcase the CVE remediation for Python packages uses a
simple project setup for use with `uv`. 

The pyproject.toml file contains all relevant configuration:

```toml
[project]
name = "uv-example"
version = "0.1.0"
description = "An example project with uv for Chainguard Libraries"
readme = "README.md"
requires-python = ">=3.13"
dependencies = [
    "flask==2.0.0",          # fix with 2.0.0+cgr.1
    "werkzeug==3.0.2",       # fix in 3.0.2+cgr.1
    "urllib3==1.26.7",       # fix in 1.26.7+cgr.1
    "setuptools==77.0.3"     # fix in 77.0.3+cgr.1
]

[[tool.uv.index]]
name = "nexus"
#url = "http://localhost:8081/repository/python-all/simple/"
url = "http://localhost:8081/repository/python-all-remediated/simple/"
```

Note the declared dependencies just using the plain semantic version. These
versions are resolved to the specific versions with the CVE fixes in place if
the remediated packages are available.

The script sets up a new virtual environment, builds the project with uv, and
then scans for vulnerabilities with grype:

```shell
rm -rf bin dist uv.lock
python3 -m venv .
source ./bin/activate
uv cache clean
rm -rf lib include
uv build
uv lock
grype .
```
