The June 2025 Learning Lab with Patrick Smyth covers Chainguard Libraries for
Python. Open source libraries help you move fast, but pulling in external
dependencies can introduce supply chain risk. This session covers fundamental
concepts of Chainguard Libraries, package managers and dependencies, PyPI and
build tools, configuring repository managers, and running example application builds.

## Event Details

**Date:** June 24, 2025  
**Time:** 1:00 PM - 2:00 PM EDT  
**Presenter:** Patrick Smyth, Staff Developer Relations Engineer at Chainguard

## Topics Covered

- Software supply chain fundamentals
