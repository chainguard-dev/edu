The June 2025 Learning Lab with Patrick Smyth covers Chainguard Libraries for
Python. Open source libraries help you move fast, but pulling in external
dependencies can introduce supply chain risk. This session covers fundamental
concepts of Chainguard Libraries, package managers and dependencies, PyPI and
build tools, configuring repository managers, and running example application builds.

## Event Details

**Date:** June 24, 2025  
**Time:** 1:00 PM - 2:00 PM EDT  
**Presenter:** Patrick Smyth, Staff Developer Relations Engineer at Chainguard  
[Register](https://events.chainguard.dev/0bcb08ad-2ba1-447b-b87e-703f04d7ef11/)

## Topics

- Software supply chain fundamentals
- The Python ecosystem under threat
- Package managers and dependencies in Python
- PyPI and Python build tools
- Configuring repository managers for Python
- Running an example application on Libraries
- Checking provenance of dependencies

## Demo

In the demo, we'll switch the below Flask application to use Chainguard Libraries for Python, sourcing dependencies for a repository manager (Artifactory) set up to pull first from the Chaingaurd Libraries for Python index with a fallback to the Python Package Index (PyPI).

[Demo Flask Application](https://github.com/chainguard-dev/cg-images-python-migration/tree/libraries-demo)

We'll demonstrate two approaches. First, we'll modify the `~/.pip/pip.conf` file to pull from the virtual repository set up in the repository manager. 

```
[global]
index-url = <repository-url>
```

After changing this global setting, we'll install and run the application from a virtual environment, then use Chainguard's `libcheck` tool to test the provenance of the packages in the virtual environment. (Chainguard is in the process of releasing this tool under an open source license.)

We'll also update the demo application's `requirements.txt` file and build and run the application from a Chainguard Container.
