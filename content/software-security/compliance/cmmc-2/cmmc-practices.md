In total, Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (CMMC) 2.0 has 130 practices, though only Level 3 needs to meet them all. These practices are divided into 14 domains, each of which covers a different aspect of cybersecurity.

Wait, you may be wondering. Are “practices” the same as “controls” or “requirements?”  This can be a point of confusion, as CMMC 2.0 refers to its requirements as “practices”, yet the majority are taken from NIST SP 800-171 and NIST SP 800-172 standards or requirements.

## Naming Conventions for CMMC 2.0 Practices/Controls

CMMC 2.0 practices are labeled using the format “DD.L#-REQ”, where:
- DD is the two-letter domain abbreviation
- L# is the level number
- REQ is the NIST SP 800-171 Rev 2 or NIST SP 800-172 security requirement number

## CMMC 2.0 Practice/Control Domains

Below is a table overview of the domains:

| Domain                          | Description                                                                                                   | Example Practice/Control                                     |
|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| **Access Control (AC)**          | Manages and restricts access to information systems to ensure that only authorized users and processes can interact with the system, protecting sensitive data from unauthorized access. | AC.L1-3.1.22 - Control information posted or processed on publicly accessible information systems. |
| **Awareness and Training (AT)**  | Ensures that personnel are educated on cybersecurity practices and aware of their roles in maintaining security, improving overall organizational resilience against cyber threats. | AT.L2-3.2.3 - Provide security awareness training on recognizing and reporting potential indicators of insider threat. |
| **Audit and Accountability (AU)**| Involves the logging and monitoring of system activities to track and review actions, ensuring accountability and providing a means to detect and respond to potential security incidents. | AU.L2-3.3.2 - Ensure that the actions of individual system users can be uniquely traced to those users so they can be held accountable for their actions. |
| **Configuration Management (CM)**| Establishes and maintains secure configurations for information systems to prevent vulnerabilities, ensuring that systems are set up and managed in a consistent and secure manner. | CM.L2-3.4.2 - Establish and enforce security configuration settings for information technology products employed in organizational systems. |
| **Identification and Authentication (IA)** | Focuses on verifying the identity of users and devices to ensure that only authorized individuals and systems can access or interact with the organization’s information assets. | IA.L2-3.5.5 - Prevent reuse of identifiers for a defined period. |
| **Incident Response (IR)**       | Involves preparing for and responding to cybersecurity incidents through structured plans and regular testing, ensuring that the organization can effectively manage and mitigate the impact of incidents. | IR.L2-3.6.2 - Track, document, and report incidents to designated officials and/or authorities both internal and external to the organization. |
| **Maintenance (MA)**             | Addresses the processes and procedures for maintaining and updating systems, ensuring that maintenance activities are performed securely. | MA.L2-3.7.1 - Perform maintenance on organizational systems. |
| **Media Protection (MP)**        | Focuses on protecting information stored on physical and digital media through encryption and other security measures to safeguard data from unauthorized access and exposure. | MP.L2-3.8.2 - Limit access to CUI on system media to authorized users. |
| **Personnel Security (PS)**      | Manages security risks related to personnel by ensuring thorough background checks and security clearances, addressing potential vulnerabilities from insider threats. | PS.L2-3.9.1 - Screen individuals prior to authorizing access to organizational systems containing CUI. |
| **Physical Protection (PE)**     | Protects physical locations and systems through access controls, surveillance, and other security measures to prevent unauthorized physical access and potential tampering. | PE.L1-3.10.3 - Escort visitors and monitor visitor activity. |
| **Risk Assessment (RA)**        | Assessing and remediating risks and vulnerabilities in organizational operations, assets, and systems.   | RA.L2-3.11.2 - Scan for vulnerabilities in organizational systems and applications periodically |
| **Security Assessment (CA)**     | Involves evaluating the effectiveness of security controls through assessments and addressing any identified vulnerabilities to continuously improve the security posture. | CA.L2-3.12.1 - Periodically assess the security controls in organizational systems to determine if the controls are effective in their application. |
| **System and Communications Protection (SC)** | Focuses on securing communications and data transmitted across networks to protect information from interception and unauthorized access. | SC.L2-3.13.3 - Separate user functionality from system management functionality. |
| **System and Information Integrity (SI)** | Ensures the integrity of systems and information by monitoring for unauthorized changes, protecting against malicious code, and applying updates to maintain system security. | SI.L2-3.14.7 - Identify unauthorized use of organizational systems. |
