# Overview of CMMC 2.0 Framework

The  **Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (CMMC) 2.0 ** integrates various cybersecurity standards and best practices into a unified model that encompasses three maturity levels. Each level builds upon the previous one, with increasing rigor in cybersecurity practices and processes. In this article, weâ€™ll provide an overview of the three levels of maturity and example practices that are representative of their requirements.

## Level 1: Foundational

Contractors and subcontractors who handle only FCI typically need this level of certification. This is particularly relevant for small businesses that provide basic products or services without dealing with sensitive information. For example, a company supplying standard office supplies to a government agency would fall under this category. The focus at this level is on maintaining basic safeguards by implementing 17 fundamental cybersecurity practices. These practices are primarily derived from the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 52.204-21, a set of rules for government procurement in the United States. They are designed to to protect FCI by ensuring that essential, straightforward protections are in place.

**Example Practices:**
- Limiting information system access to authorized users.
- Conducting background checks on employees.
- Implementing basic measures such as antivirus and firewalls.

### Level 2: Advanced

Contractors and subcontractors who handle CUI but do not require the highest level of security typically need Level 2 certification. This is relevant for companies involved in more complex projects that deal with sensitive, though not highly classified, data. For instance, a contractor providing technical support for military communication systems, where sensitive but not classified information is exchanged, would require this level. Level two consists of implementing a subset of the security requirements specified in NIST SP 800-171, totaling 110 practices. This level is designed as a transitional step for organizations aiming to achieve Level 3, building upon the foundational practices established in Level 1.

**Example Practices:**
- Implementing multifactor authentication.
- Conducting regular vulnerability assessments.
- Establishing and maintaining an operational incident-handling capability for organizational
systems.

### Level 3: Expert

Contractors handling highly sensitive CUI and involved in critical defense programs typically require this level of certification. This applies to large defense contractors developing advanced military technologies, such as a company designing next-generation fighter jets for the DoD. The focus at this level is on advanced and proactive cyber hygiene, requiring organizations to implement all 110 practices from NIST SP 800-171, along with additional practices from a subset of NIST SP 800-172.

This level demands advanced security measures to protect CUI against advanced persistent threats (APTs), such as cyber-espionage campaigns, zero-day exploits, and coordinated attacks targeting vulnerabilities in critical infrastructure. It requires tri-annual government-lead assessment to maintain compliance.

**Example Practices:**
At the time of publication, specific Level 3 practices are still being determined. However, the Department of Defense has indicated that they will be pulled from a subset of NIST SP 800-172, Enhanced Security Requirements for Protecting Controlled Unclassified Information.

Each CMMC level builds upon the previous one, ensuring that as organizations progress through the levels, their cybersecurity posture becomes more robust and capable of addressing increasingly sophisticated threats. This tiered approach allows organizations of varying sizes and capabilities to incrementally improve their cybersecurity measures while meeting the specific requirements necessary to handle sensitive information.
