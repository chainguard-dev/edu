CMMC 2.0, or Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification, is a cybersecurity framework established by the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD). It aims to ensure that contractors and subcontractors within the Defense Industrial Base (DIB) comply with rigorous cybersecurity standards. CMMC 2.0 replaces the previous CMMC model with a streamlined and updated version that incorporates lessons learned and feedback from industry stakeholders.

If you are a contractor, subcontractor, or supplier contracting with the DoD, you will need to meet the requirements of CMMC 2.0 regardless of the size of your organization or the type of product or service you are providing. This guide will provide a comprehensive overview of CMMC 2.0, detailing its practices, the importance of compliance, and practical guidance on meeting its requirements. At the end of this guide, you will learn how Chainguard Images can be used to significantly reduce the toil and time needed to achieve CMMC 2.0 compliance.

## Who is Required to be Compliant?

CMMC 2.0 compliance is mandatory for all organizations involved in DoD contracts where Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) and Federal Contract Information (FCI) is handled. This includes:

- **Prime Contractors**: Organizations directly awarded contracts by the DoD that must meet specific CMMC certification levels based on contract requirements.
- **Subcontractors**: Companies providing goods or services to prime contractors, especially if they handle or access CUI or FCI.
- **Suppliers**: Entities within the supply chain that interact with sensitive information relevant to DoD projects.

The DIB encompasses a wide variety of contractors and suppliers, including commercial firms, not-for-profit research centers and university laboratories, and government-owned industrial facilities. The products and services these entities provide are even more diverse, ranging from large sophisticated weapons platforms (e.g., missile defense systems) to highly specialized operational support (e.g., satellite communications) to general commercial products (e.g., medical equipment). Regardless of the type of organization or the product or service they provide, all contractors servicing the DIB must achieve compliance with CMMC 2.0. However, as we will discuss more below, the compliance requirements vary according to the specific CMMC maturity level required for the contract in question.

## What Are FCI and CUI?

**FCI** refers to information provided by or generated for the government under a contract that is not intended for public release. It includes data related to the performance of government contracts but does not involve classified or highly sensitive information. For example, an office furniture supplier providing delivery schedules and product specifications to a government agency under a contract would be handling FCI.

**CUI** is more sensitive and requires specific safeguarding and dissemination practices. CUI includes information that, while not classified, still requires protection under federal laws, regulations, or government-wide policies due to its potential impact on national security or other critical interests. A defense contractor managing blueprints for a new military vehicle that is not classified but still needs to be protected under export control laws would be handling CUI.

## Impact of Non-Compliance

Failure to comply with CMMC 2.0 can have several significant impacts:

- **Contract Loss**: Organizations that do not meet the required CMMC level will be ineligible for DoD contracts, leading to a loss of business opportunities and revenue.
- **Reputational Damage**: Non-compliance can damage an organizationâ€™s reputation, affecting relationships with clients and partners and potentially deterring future business opportunities.
- **Legal and Financial Penalties**: Organizations may face legal actions and financial penalties, especially if a security breach occurs involving sensitive information.
- **Increased Risk**: Non-compliance increases the risk of data breaches and cyberattacks, which can compromise organizational and client data.

Achieving compliance with CMMC 2.0 is not just a regulatory requirement but a critical step in safeguarding national security and contracting with the DoD.
