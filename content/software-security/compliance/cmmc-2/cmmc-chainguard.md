Achieving Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (CMMC) 2.0 Level 2 or Level 3 certification can be a complex and resource-intensive process, particularly for organizations managing containerized environments and addressing vulnerabilities. Chainguard simplifies this journey by offering specialized solutions that drastically reduce the time and effort needed to meet compliance requirements. Our FIPS-compliant (Federal Information Processing Standard) images, combined with detailed SBOM (Software Bill of Materials) and STIG-hardened (Security Technical Implementation Guide) configurations, provide a strong foundation for meeting the requirements of CMMC 2.0.

## What are STIG-Hardened FIPS Images?

STIG-hardened FIPS images are pre-configured container images that have been secured according to the Security Technical Implementation Guide (STIG) standards set by the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA). These images meet stringent federal security requirements, combining FIPS-compliant encryption with robust security configurations that protect against vulnerabilities and threats. By using STIG-hardened FIPS images, organizations ensure that their systems adhere to federal encryption standards and best practices for cybersecurity, making them particularly valuable in environments that require high levels of security, such as those governed by CMMC 2.0.

## Why STIG-Hardened FIPS Images for CMMC 2.0?

STIG-hardened FIPS images are highly beneficial for achieving CMMC 2.0 compliance due to their enhanced security features and adherence to strict guidelines. Here’s how they can support your CMMC 2.0 efforts:

1. **Enhanced Security Posture**
   STIG hardening applies a set of security configurations and practices designed to protect systems from vulnerabilities and threats. By utilizing STIG-hardened FIPS images, organizations ensure that their systems meet rigorous security standards, reducing the risk of exploitation. This is particularly important for CMMC 2.0 Level 2 and Level 3 requirements, which emphasize advanced security practices and robust protection of Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) and Federal Contract Information (FCI).

2. **Streamlined Compliance**
   FIPS-compliant images meet federal encryption standards, which are a key component of CMMC 2.0 requirements. STIG hardening adds an additional layer of security by ensuring that the system configurations are in line with best practices for securing systems. These hardened images come with pre-configured settings that address many of the CMMC controls, such as those related to access control, vulnerability management, and incident response, thereby simplifying the compliance process and reducing the time and effort needed to achieve certification.

3. **Simplified Reporting and Documentation**
   STIG-hardened FIPS images typically include detailed scan reports and documentation that can be used to demonstrate compliance with CMMC 2.0 controls. These reports help organizations quickly identify and address security gaps, and the detailed documentation supports the creation of necessary reports for auditors and assessors. This streamlining of the reporting process aids in maintaining and proving compliance with CMMC requirements, such as those related to vulnerability management (e.g., CM.2.062 and CM.3.068) and continuous monitoring (e.g., SC.3.177).

By leveraging Chainguard’s resources, organizations can accelerate their path to CMMC 2.0 certification while effectively managing and reporting on critical security controls. Our integrated approach not only ensures that compliance requirements are met but also enhances overall security posture, allowing organizations to focus on their core operations with confidence.
