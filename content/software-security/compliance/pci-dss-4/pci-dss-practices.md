PCI DSS 4.0, or Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard is intended for all entities that store, process, or transmit cardholder data and/or authentication data that could impact the security of the cardholder data environment. This includes all entities interacting with information such as the following:

| Cardholder Data |
|------------------------|
| Primary account number |
| Cardholder name |
| Expiration data |

| Authentication Data |
|-------------------------------------------------------|
| Full track data, such as on a magnetic stripe or chip |
| Card verification code (the number on the back) |
| PINs |

PCI DSS 4.0 requires compliance with a set of requirements, each related to an information security practice or goal. All of these are intended to protect cardholder data from theft and fraud.


## PCI DSS 4.0 Goals and Requirements

| **Protect account data** | Protect stored account data as well as during transmission over open, public networks |
| **Maintain a vulnerability management program** | Protect all systems and networks from malicious software, develop and maintain secure systems and software |
| **Implement strong access control measures** | Restrict access to system components and cardholder data y business need to know, identify users and authenticate access to system components, restrict physical access to cardholder data |
| **Regularly monitor and test networks** | Log and monitor all access to system components and cardholder data, test security of all systems regularly |
