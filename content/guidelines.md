This space is for developers, engineers, and security pros who are building and learning together to secure the software supply chain‚Äîfrom distroless containers to CVE-free deployments.

We‚Äôre glad you‚Äôre here. To keep this space productive and respectful, please follow these community guidelines:

## 1. Be kind and respectful to one another.
* Assume good intent. We all come from different backgrounds, skill levels, and communication styles.
* Encourage curiosity and questions ‚Äî no gatekeeping or shaming.

## 2. Stay on topic when posting!
* Use the relevant channels.
* Ask questions, share tips, post relevant resources.
* For memes or off-topic convos, head to #memes or #overheard ‚Äî we love a good laugh.

## 3. Help each other (there are no dumb questions, either!)
* Don't be afraid to ask ‚Äúbasic‚Äù questions‚Äîsomeone else is probably wondering the same.
* Share what worked for you. Bonus points for linking docs, examples, or GitHub issues.
* Be constructive when offering feedback or corrections.

## 4. Respect privacy & security. 
* Don‚Äôt share private customer data, credentials, or anything sensitive.
* If you see something that violates these guidelines, DM the @chainguard-team.

## 5. This is a Community, Not Support
* While Chainguard team members may participate, this Slack isn‚Äôt a replacement for official support and is outside of our formal SLAs.
* If you are interested in Enterprise Support from Chainguard, we recommend getting in touch with our Sales team to discuss options tailored to your needs.


## 6. By Being Here, You Agree To:
* Follow these guidelines.
* Help us keep this a welcoming space.
* Remember: we're building something better‚Äîtogether.

Got questions about the guidelines or ideas for improvement? DM the @chainguard-team ‚Äî we're always listening and here to help!
