# Feedback Widget System Overview

This document provides an overview of the interactive feedback system implemented on Chainguard Academy, allowing users to provide feedback on content pages.

## What is the Feedback Widget?

The feedback widget is an interactive component that appears at the end of every article page, providing users with a simple "Was this helpful?" prompt with Yes/No options. User feedback is automatically collected and stored for content improvement analysis.

## How It Works

### User Experience Flow

1. **User visits an article page** → Widget appears after content, before related articles
2. **User clicks "Yes"** → Shows thumbs up emoji and "Thanks for the feedback!" message
3. **User clicks "No"** → Shows thumbs down emoji and reveals a text input field for detailed feedback
4. **User submits feedback** → Data is sent to Google Sheets for collection and analysis

### Technical Architecture

```text
User Interaction → JavaScript → Google Apps Script → Google Sheets
```

- **Frontend**: Hugo-generated HTML with JavaScript for interactivity
- **Backend**: Google Apps Script web app for data processing  
- **Storage**: Google Sheets for feedback collection
- **Security**: Content Security Policy (CSP) configuration for external requests

| **Page Title** | Title of the page where feedback was given | `"Getting Started with Chainguard Images"` |
| **Page URL** | Full URL of the feedback page | `https://edu.chainguard.dev/chainguard/getting-started/` |
| **Feedback Type** | Type of feedback submitted | `"positive"` or `"negative"` |
| **Feedback Text** | User's detailed feedback | `"The examples were unclear"` (empty for positive feedback) |

## Security and Privacy

### Content Security Policy
The site's CSP has been updated to allow connections to:
- `https://script.google.com` (Apps Script endpoint)
- `https://script.googleusercontent.com` (Apps Script responses)

### Data Privacy
- **No personal information** is collected (no names, emails, IP addresses)
- **No tracking** beyond basic page context
- **Anonymous feedback** only - users cannot be identified
- **Public data** - all feedback is stored in accessible Google Sheets


Remember: The feedback widget helps improve content quality by providing direct user insights. Regular monitoring and response to feedback ensures the documentation continues to meet user needs effectively!
