[Chainguard Containers](https://www.chainguard.dev/chainguard-images?utm_source=cg-academy&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=dev-enablement) are a mix of distroless and development container images based on Wolfi. Daily builds make sure images are up-to-date with the latest package versions and patches from upstream Wolfi.
