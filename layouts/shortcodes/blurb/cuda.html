  <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit">Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA)</a> is a parallel computing platform developed by NVIDIA. To take advantage of connected NVIDIA GPUs, youâ€™ll need to follow the setup instructions for your local machine or create a CUDA-enabled instance on a cloud provider.
</p>
<p>
  To set up CUDA on your local machine, follow the installation instructions for <a href="https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-installation-guide-linux/index.html">Linux</a> or <a href="https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-installation-guide-microsoft-windows/index.html">Windows</a>. CUDA is not currently supported on Mac OS.
