    <a href="/chainguard/chainguard-images/features/ca-docs/custom-assembly/">Custom Assembly</a>
    tool is the officially supported approach for extending Chainguard
    Containers with additional packages. Custom Assembly automatically ensures
    all packages remain on compatible versions and handles rebuilds when
    packages are updated, eliminating version conflicts and reducing maintenance
    overhead.

<p>
    While using <code>apk add</code> to add packages in a Dockerfile or similar
    is effective, issues can arise when packages in a base image conflict with
    new packages that are added. This can be particularly pronounced when core
    packages are updated â€” there can be brief windows when the latest version of
    a base image has a conflict with the latest version of a package.
</p>
<p>
    For example, when the <code>openssl</code> package is updated, there will be
    a brief window where base images with an old and potentially incompatible
    version of <code>libcrypto</code>, and attempting to
    <code>apk add openssl</code> will fail. This conflict will be resolved in a
    few hours when a new version of the base image is released. The only way
    around this is to pin to specific versions of packages and images, which
    adds its own significant maintenance burden.
