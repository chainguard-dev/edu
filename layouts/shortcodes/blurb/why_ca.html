    Chainguard&#39;s <a href="/chainguard/chainguard-images/features/ca-docs/custom-assembly/">Custom Assembly</a> tool
    is the officially supported approach for extending Chainguard Containers with additional packages. Custom Assembly
    automatically
    ensures all packages remain on compatible versions and handles rebuilds when packages are updated, eliminating
    version
    conflicts and reducing maintenance overhead.
</p>
<p>
    While you can use <code>apk add</code> to install packages at runtime, this approach requires careful version
    pinning
    (for example, <code>apk add openssl=3.1.4-r0</code>) to avoid compatibility conflicts between the base image and
    newly installed
    packages. Without explicit version pins, timing mismatches between APK repository updates and image builds can cause
    dependency conflicts that break your containers. Even with pinning, you&#39;ll need to manually manage version
    updates to
    receive security patches.
