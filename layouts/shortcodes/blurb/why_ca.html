Chainguard's [Custom Assembly](/chainguard/chainguard-images/features/ca-docs/custom-assembly/) tool is the officially
supported approach for extending Chainguard Containers with additional packages. Custom Assembly automatically ensures
all packages remain on compatible versions and handles rebuilds when packages are updated, eliminating version conflicts
and reducing maintenance overhead.

While you can use `apk add` to install packages at runtime, this approach requires careful version pinning (for example,
`apk add openssl=3.1.4-r0`) to avoid compatibility conflicts between the base image and newly installed packages.
Without explicit version pins, timing mismatches between APK repository updates and image builds can cause dependency
conflicts that break your containers. Even with pinning, you'll need to manually manage version updates to receive
security patches.
