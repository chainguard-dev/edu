<p>
  CVEs are assigned numerical scores according to the <a href="https://www.first.org/cvss/v4.0/user-guide" target="_blank">Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)</a>, an open framework for communicating the severity of software vulnerabilities.
</p>


<p>
  CVSS scores correspond to four categories
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Critical (9.0-10.0)</li>
  <li>High (7.0-8.9)</li>
  <li>Medium (4.0-6.9)</li>
  <li>Low (0.1-3.9)</li>
</ul>

<p>
  In general, the higher the score, the more serious the vulnerability. Higher scores should be prioritized during CVE remediation.
