[System Package Data Exchange (SPDX)](https://spdx.dev/) is a file format for representing Software Bills of Materials (SBOMs), or itemized metadata on packages contained in a software artifact.

The SPDX specification is based on an open standard and is maintained by the SPDX Project, part of the Linux Foundation.
