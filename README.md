Our **mission** is to enable developers to build software efficiently and securely with Chainguard. Visit our website at ðŸ”— [edu.chainguard.dev](https://edu.chainguard.dev)

You can find the educational resource files in Markdown under the `content` directory.

## Development

This site is based on the [Doks Hugo theme](https://github.com/h-enk/doks).

If you would like to develop this project, clone this repo and install dependencies with `npm`.

```sh
npm install
```

To run a local version of this site, use npm to start it.

```sh
npm run start
```

You'll then navigate to `localhost:1313` within the web browser of your choice.

## ðŸ“‘ Contributing

If you identify something that is a major change, please file an [issue](https://github.com/chainguard-dev/edu/issues/new). If you identify a minor change like a typo that needs to be updated, or tech tooling that has a newer package, you are welcome to open a pull request for review from the team.

### Date Format

In each post's header, the date format should follow year-month-day as `YYYY-MM-DD`.

### Adding Graphic Images

Please reduce the image's file size before adding the image to this project to make page loadtimes faster and more accessible. You can use a tool such as [TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com/).

If you are using images, it's best to bundle it together with the appropriate Markdown file. Create a directory with the name of the new page. Within the directory, create an `index.md` file and add the images within the directory as well.

In practice, this will look like the following, with images in place for both the `getting-started-enforce-github` directory and the `install-enforce-github` directory and the relevant tutorials:

```sh
â”œâ”€â”€ chainguard
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ _index.md
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ enforce-github
â”‚Â Â  â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ _index.md
â”‚Â Â  â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ getting-started-enforce-github
â”‚Â Â  â”‚Â Â  â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ check.png
â”‚Â Â  â”‚Â Â  â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ index.md
â”‚Â Â  â”‚Â Â  â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ protected-branch.png
â”‚Â Â  â”‚Â Â  â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ repo-access.png
â”‚Â Â  â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ install-enforce-github
â”‚Â Â  â”‚Â Â      â”œâ”€â”€ configure.png
â”‚Â Â  â”‚Â Â      â”œâ”€â”€ index.md
â”‚Â Â  â”‚Â Â      â”œâ”€â”€ permissions.png
â”‚Â Â  â”‚Â Â      â””â”€â”€ user-select.png
```

Within the Markdown file, add images like so, with the alt text at the front:

```
![Protect branches with Chainguard Enforce](protected-branch.png)
```

Run a local development environment to ensure that your file structure is set up as intended.

### Adding Videos

Use a liquid tag within the Markdown to embed a YouTube video. For example, if you would like to link to the YouTube video located at [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqIcDrg1XOs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqIcDrg1XOs), you can pull the string after `v=` and use the following liquid tag on its own line within Markdown.

```
{{< youtube rqIcDrg1XOs >}}
```

### Adding Tags

Tags are autogenerated when you add the following line to a Markdown file's front matter:

`tags: ["Tag1", Tag2", etc]`

This line should appear between the `draft` line and the `images` line in the front matter.

For example:

```
...
draft: false
tags: ["Chainguard Containers", "Overview", "Product"]
images: []
menu:
...
```

When applying tags, please make sure they conform to the working tag list below so that the tagging logic is consistent. If you'd like to add a new tag or suggest a tag revision, please submit a PR with a justification for the change.

Tags are based on:

- _Content topics_ covered in the content, such as tools (Enforce, apko, etc), orgs/standards (OCI, SLSA, etc), and other relevant topics (SBOMs, etc).
- _Content types_ represented by the content, such as procedural, conceptual, interactive, troubleshooting, etc.

You can review our current list of [Tags](https://edu.chainguard.dev/tags).
