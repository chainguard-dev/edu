This script will output a Markdown formatted table showing the differences between Wolfi and other distro's busybox and coreutils packages.

To run it:

```
python compare.py debian
```

The data is stored in [../../data/distro-package-comparisons.json](../../data/distro-package-comparisons.json).

Distros can be added there as needed.
